Professor Ronn: I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program
In the end, the results were not favorable
I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability
After talking with you and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance
I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year
I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level
I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test
Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business
Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me
It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future
Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Ben Rogers
