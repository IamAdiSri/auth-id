Michael:How s your summer?
Are you in Delaware now?
I am going to set up a weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming weekend
I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out with, but will take other suggestions
I will be sending out e-mails to everyone informing them of the weekend
Choby is going to set up a bar to rent out for Saturday night
In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it
If you could send me a list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great
Thanks for the help and lets talk about this further
Talk to you soon.Ben
