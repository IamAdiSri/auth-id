Dr. Harris: I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt mine did
I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in attending the Business School
I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class (Financial Management), which I received an A. I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time
I have also decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking
I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT
I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision
When I hear back from GMAC, I am planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score
As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I m in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile
Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile
Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon
