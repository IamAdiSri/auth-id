Hey Mike,Thanks for the pics
Where were the ones from which looks to be a wedding?
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about?
Were you thinking two for you and your Dad?
That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000
I m not sure whether that is Easter weekend or not
One other way to get tics is to go to www.finalfourseats.com Let me know your situation
Where are you spending the New Year?
Talk to you later.Ben
