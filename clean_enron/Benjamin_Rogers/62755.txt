Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning
I need 1 set of transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and three-holed punched at the top
If graphics can "clean it" up a little bit that would be great
I am trying to finish one more slide in this presentation but please go forward with this due to time constraints
Please give me a call if you have any questions
ThanksBen3-7998
