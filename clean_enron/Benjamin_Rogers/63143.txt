Thanks for the note, except of course for the last comment, why don t you just go seat in row 100 - alright
Megan and I had a great time and enjoyed having you guys come out
I love going out there during the summer
We are going to arrange a ski weekend on President Day Weekend this February - so make plans to be laughed at while skiing
I didn t mean laughed at - I meant having a fun time
Talk to you soon.Ben
