Robbie:I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just recently
What I m looking for is a private Math tutor
I wasn t sure if I had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you
I liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on one sessions
If you could let me know, I would appreciate it
Thanks!Ben Rogers(713) 853-7998
