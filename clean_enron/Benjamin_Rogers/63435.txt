Charlie:I got your message this morning
Since we were so successful in selling some of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are running like crazy to close these deals this year
I want to let you know that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company and the types of transactions that you guys are doing
I have not had the chance to follow up, but plan to real soon
I just tried to call you about 10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response
I will try again in a little bit
Hope all is going well and I ll talk to you soon.Ben
