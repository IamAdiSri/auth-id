I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday
Nepco will take till the following Monday to turn the doc
around
I told him we need it sooner than that, but he seems to think that is the standard time of return
We need to find out from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc
We will meet with Bruce on Wednesday
We also may want to think about going up there with an Engineer to visit the site
We can talk more on Monday.Ben
