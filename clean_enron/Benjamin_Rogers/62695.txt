Tom Swank, the originator and I sat down with Bruce Golden and went through the porject cost numbers for the GE 7FA combined cycle facility
At this point we need to claculate FOM and VOM and other operating expenses
We feel pretty good about the project cost numbers
Let me know if you need more info than I have already given you
Bruce Golden has the soft copy of the project cost numbers
ThanksBen
