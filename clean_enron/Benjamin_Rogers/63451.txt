Michael:Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions
I didn t have time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back
As you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys lose these assets to legal issues
I know we both can come to some middle ground before people lose their patience
My only advice, for what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don t run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side
Hope this helps.Ben
