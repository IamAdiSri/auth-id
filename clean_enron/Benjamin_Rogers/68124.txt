Dad:I heard that CIN summer is down to $32 - $33
Gas is going to be below $2.00 for the summer by March
Looks like your idea to short the whole year at $32.00 was a very good idea
Again make sure your guys are looking at it right
I think summer CIN will get to be around $28 before April and thats when you start buying it up
Let me know what you think
Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today
I need to talk to you about a couple of things
Please give me a call at home when you get the chance.Ben
