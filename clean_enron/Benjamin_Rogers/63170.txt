Hey Mike:You won t believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - Marlon and Marissa s. As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, Sammy, Amy, etc
It should be pretty interesting to say the least
I am also running in this year s NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in November
So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough to arrange
How was Patty s wedding -it looked like alot of fun
I still want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I m just not sure where at this point - I still think DC
Let me know what you think.Ben
