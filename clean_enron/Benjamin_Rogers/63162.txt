Iaia:How the hell are ya?
Wanted to drop you a line and see how you were doing and let you know that Brandon and I continued the tradition and went to the DMB concert last night
Must say that it wasn t the same as being with you in a limo, but we still had fun
Wanted to get your number up there, b/c I will be up in Chicago for Thanksgiving and was hoping to meet you in Chicago then
Gotta run, but I hope all is going well and I ll talk to you soon.Ben
