Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000 s. At first they were interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in the equipment
They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000 s as possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000 s per plant
With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 per turbine
Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 1st Qtr
01
If they are still interested they will get back with me with a non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks
Please let me know if you have any comments
Thank you!Ben
