With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics regarding GE 7FA s. Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 2 steam turbines; 3
Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW s and will be run as a combined cycle facility
If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great
This project is not due till Wednesday
ThanksBen
