Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is currently in charge of my application in the admission s office
He wants me to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework
That is why I wanted to meet with you and Professors Titman and Brown, to discuss the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses
I know that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background, and the Business School s team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in this type of learning environment
I hope things work out and thanks again for your help.Ben
