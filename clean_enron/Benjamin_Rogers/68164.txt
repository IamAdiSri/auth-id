Mr. Lay:It was good to see you down on the trading floor today
I have been in the power trading group for about a year now
I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy
I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals
Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron s bottom line
Eventhough Enron s stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound
I hope all is going well!
Regards,Ben
