I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently
Work has slowed down a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two
I have traded calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven t talked to her in some time
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or not
We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world
Or maybe you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about
Talk to you soon.Love Ben
