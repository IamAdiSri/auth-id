I just wanted to let you know that I sent this letter to Dr. Harris addresses his concerns and stating my commitment to succeeding at The Texas Graduate School of Business
I hope I have done what it takes to prove that I can succeed at the School
Thanks again for your help and interest
Sincerely,Ben
