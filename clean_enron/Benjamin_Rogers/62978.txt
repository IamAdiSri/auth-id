Dave:I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and very early in discussions that a "CA" at this time was not needed
There were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement
They were not willing to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA"
Let me know if this is your thoughts as well
Thanks!Ben
