Hey man - good to hear from you
It must be rough house sitting in River Oaks, just remember to leave the furniture before you go back to school
Next week would be great to get some brews
My wife and I are moving this weekend so it is quite hectic this week
I will need a lot of booze after this move!
How s Chase?
I ll talk to you soon.Ben
