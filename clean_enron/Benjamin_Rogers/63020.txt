Dr. Ueng:I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn t have time
I was taking this course because I am applying to another business school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide the other schools with a recent academic record
I was trying to get an A in the class, but my first test was not my best work
I feel that I did much better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level
That said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly appreciate it
I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great
Thanks for making the class educational and quite enjoyable
Hope to talk to you soon and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer
Regards,Ben Rogers713-853-7998
