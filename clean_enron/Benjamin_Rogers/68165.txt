Chobs:Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here
Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down
Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies
They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets
Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price
Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%
