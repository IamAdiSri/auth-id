Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a WinZip file
You may want to check it against the previous model they sent to us to see what has changed
I will be putting together questions on the model they sent over
Let me know when you would like to sit down and go through them
Bruce - you may want to go through it to check the O&M assumptions
Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin Norris a call
