Jerry:Here is the latest "CA" with everyone s changes
I feel that this is pretty close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and non-solicitation agreements
Enron usually does not get into stand-still agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron
Look forward to talking to you tomorrow morning
Thanks for your patience
Again, this is a draft copy for discussions purposes only.Regards,Ben
