Mike:My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him
He doesn t want them to get lost in the mail
We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving over Sat and Monday for the games
The best thing to do is meet at a certain gate # or the "will call window"
I will call your Dad next week and set things up on a meeting place before the game
Leave me your Dad s home number so I can call him next week
These guys are going to have a great time that weekend
Talk to you soon.Ben Home #: 713-355-8738Work #: 713-853-7998
