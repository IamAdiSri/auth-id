Rodney:Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the entire reg.risk process
For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust the reg.risk book
I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them
I was in yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not come up with them
In rotating down to East Orig
I lost a box of stuff, but I didn t think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the case
Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point
Again, sorry for the delay
