The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk Management Product went really well
We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was on the phone from Denver
They were very interested with regards to potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product
Enron could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year through year 15 or 20
We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and Michigan
They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling agreements in place for those projects
The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product
Please let me know if you have any questions with this matter
Thanks!Ben
