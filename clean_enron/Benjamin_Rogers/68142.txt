Unfortunately yes
The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform unwind and liquidation functions
The trading group, the group I am in, is really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probably be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM
I wouldn t mind that because they understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and fixed income
This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about over leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as important as what to do in business
99% of the folks are good hardworking people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company down
It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off
It was so sad
Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options last year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as my mom likes to say
On a good note we got your picture of the little tike, looks great
I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail
