Amy:I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the Princeton Review
I have realized that I need one on one sessions to help me really prepare for the GMAT
If you can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it
I was looking to start sessions as soon as possible
Again, thanks for your help with this issue.Ben(713) 853-7998
