Professor Titman:Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office
I wanted to ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission s people understand the reason for my GMAT score
I know that this is a poor reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and be successful in the learning environment at UT
If I need to, I can provide the admissions office the documents stating the disability
If you can let me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it
Thanks agin!Ben
