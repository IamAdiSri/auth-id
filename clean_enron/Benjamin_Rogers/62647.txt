Hey there; "Do you know who your "big toe" is yet?
Do you swallow alot of aggression along with alot of pizzas?
Well if you do, then you are going to be a lean, mean fighting machine
I finally finished all of my applications and have had several interviews with Columbia and Rice
Duke is in a couple of weeks
I ll probably here from NYU in the next couple of weeks
We were in St. Barts for New Years and it was awesome
We need to have a huge party when you get back in the summer
I talk to Gioffre quite a bit now and we are trying to get a lot of people together this summer
Hope your trip is going well and Keep in touch
I ll let you know how the B-School results come in
Talk to you soon.Ben
