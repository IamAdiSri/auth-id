Bill:Here are the two CA s we are currently working off of
The first one is Enron s latest draft and the second one is Cinergy s latest draft
Enron usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this case
We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these differences
Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through these issues
Thanks for your time with this issue.Regards,Ben 713-853-7998Enron s version Cinergy s version
