Dr. Harris:Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for this exam
Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to help strengthen my overall application file
Again, thanks for the fast response to my e-mail
Hope to hear from you soon!Sincerely, Ben
