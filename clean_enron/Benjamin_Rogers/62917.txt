Dave: I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan s VP of Corp Development and they would be interested in talking with us about contributing their 5,000 MW s of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead into a public offering
We are still under several different CA s with them, due to our past conversation s regarding generation
With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion Project, but at that time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the delivery of the turbines
In light of our past discussions and KMI s desire to exit the generation business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy"
Also, it would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other parties
I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth story to Wall Street
If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan
Thanks!
Ben
