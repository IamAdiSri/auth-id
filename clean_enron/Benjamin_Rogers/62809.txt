Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals
The two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy
Relient ended up buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so there is a little competition
The delivery dates are a little further out than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003
Hope this helps
Talk to you soon.Ben
