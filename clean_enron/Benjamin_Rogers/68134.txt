Joe:Thanks for the call
My e-mail at work, which is fine to send it to, is benjamin.rogers@enron.com
My e-mail at home is rogersofenron@yahoo.com
I talked with Harry yesterday and he is bringing up with him all the resumes of the guys we are thinking about bringing over
Do you want him to give them to McCabe or you or both when he is up there?
Maybe someone should give hime a call before that to have the resumes sent up there sooner
I will send you and McCabe my resume today
I look foward to coming up to Cincy Wednesday to talk to you guys about these opportunities.Regards,Ben
