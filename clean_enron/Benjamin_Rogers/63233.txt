Professor Titman: I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn t go too quickly
I hope you remember who I am from last years application process
I enjoyed meeting you last year and talking with you regarding the curriculum and admissions process
I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in attending the Business School
I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class (Financial Management), which I received an A. I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time
I have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking and runs through December
I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT
I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision
As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I m in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile
I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, who heads up the admissions process to inform him of these recent developments
Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile
Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon Regards,Ben RogersEnron Corp.P.S
David Martin says hello!
