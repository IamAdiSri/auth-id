Good Morning!Wanted to see how this quarters earnings report was going to look like
Many of analyst are reporting that its going to be around $.57 for the qtr
Hope you guys beat that estimate
By the way, how did that deal go that you were working on with the company down here?
I saw that Convergent was bought by an independent oil and gas company from Houston
It s up big today
Hope all is going well and that you might give me a call before the end of the year
Thanks!Ben
