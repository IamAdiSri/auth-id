Dave:I hope all is going well
I left you an e-mail regarding coming over to work for you
I decided to not except the UBS deal, so I wanted to come work for you and Janet
Since I have already talked with these guys, I am pretty much available today going forward
Again, you know what I have done and I think it would be a good fit
Hope to hear from you soon.Regards,Ben
