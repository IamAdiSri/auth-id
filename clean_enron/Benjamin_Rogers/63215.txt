I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001
At that point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines
Regarding the balance sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been amortizing it each month as its been paid
Let me know if you need anything else.Ben
