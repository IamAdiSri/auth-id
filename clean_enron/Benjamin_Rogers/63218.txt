It wasn t like I was neglecting you
You must understand that e-mail is faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there is not always an immediate return
Some people are lazy with returning e-mail
It has been really busy here
We are working long hours and this project is trying to close by the end of the year
It s a $1 Billion project, so it takes alot of work
Talk to you soon.Ben
