Stan:I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of our power plants with the Generation Investments Group
I also wanted to say congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!
If there is any chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other day
He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a great job and I greatly appreciated it
Hope all is going well and I look forward to talking to you soon.Regards,Ben
