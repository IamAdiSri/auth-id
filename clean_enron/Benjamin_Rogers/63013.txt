Lisa:Congrats on everything thats going on in your life!
I also wanted to congratulate you on getting into the NYC Marathon - I think thats great
I am subjecting myself to do this again (don t ask me why) since I found out that I got in the other day
Good luck and hope to hear form you soon.Regards,Ben
