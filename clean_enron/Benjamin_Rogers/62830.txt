First of all you may be skinny, but your a skinny geek - oh does that sound?
I am sending in my application in this week
Regarding grad school, I have gotten a couple of no s, but haven t heard from all the school s, but I am considering a position with an investment bank in NYC in their global power M&A Group
Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time
I am training for the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin
And you call me fatty!!
I m heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike Gioffre s Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy
OB and I went out to dinner in NYC when I was up their last week
We went to a really expensive sushi place - it was awesome
He seams to be doing well - he is considering going to a dot.com
Gotta go!
I ll talk to you soon.Ben
