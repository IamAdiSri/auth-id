Good to hear from you
Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the year
It is very upsetting to hear about Kara
Seems like she has a long way to go to recovery, but I m optimistic that she can get to where she needs to be
I talked to her Sunday morning
She seemed upbeat
I hope the place she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its kind of a wake up call
Let me know how Megan and I can help
Megan is going to get this really good book on Manic Depression
Hope we can talk about this soon.Love, Your Son
