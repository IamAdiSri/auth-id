Dr. Harris: In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this summer
I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most appropriate with regards to my application
Just to let you know, I was planning on taking two finance courses
Thanks in advance for your suggestion with this matter
I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but was not able to stick around
Hope all is going well and hope to hear from you soon
Regards,Ben Rogers
