Stan:Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here
I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons
These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets
Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading
I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago
Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management
I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here
I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group
Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn t change what I have experienced
Thanks again for being such a good friend
Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything
I will send you my new information at Cinergy
My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.Regards,Ben
