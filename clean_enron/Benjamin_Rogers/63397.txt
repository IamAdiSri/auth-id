Charlie:I just got back from NYC - I ran in the NYC Marathon yesterday
It was a lot of fun and pretty good weather, but my time was a little slower than I would have wanted (4:27)
If Wednesday or Thursday works for you, I would like to come up to the Woodlands and meet with you over lunch
I hope all is going well and I ll talk to you soon.Ben
