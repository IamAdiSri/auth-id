Hey Jon;Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing
Megan and I are going over to Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can t believe it
I ve been trying to work on the golf game, but I m taking a couple of graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the weekends as well
Hope all is well and I ll talk to you soon.Go Sox!Ben
