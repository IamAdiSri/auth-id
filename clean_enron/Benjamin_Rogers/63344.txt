Charlie:Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from traveling
We are working hard to sell these assets before year-end - they re a beast
This Friday does not look good for lunch, but I think Tuesday or Wednesday of next week works
I hope this works for you as well
Talk to you soon.Regards,Ben
