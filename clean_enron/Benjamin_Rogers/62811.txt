Dr. Harris:Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an hour ago
I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall application file
I must say, due to my disability, I don t think my score would improve dramatically
I can also send you a summary (or the whole report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my disability
I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work
If you could let me know what information would help best explain my disability, I would appreciate it
Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay
Ben
