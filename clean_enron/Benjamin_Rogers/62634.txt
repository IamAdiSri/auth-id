The guy you are talking about left CIN under a "cloud of suspicion" sort of speak
He was the one who got into several bad deals and PPA s in California for CIN, thus he left on a bad note
Let me know if you need more detail than that, I felt this was the type of info you were looking for
Thanks!Ben
