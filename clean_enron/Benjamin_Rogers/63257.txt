Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site visits to the plants
As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule
In terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and Wheatland will be Ross Newlin
These guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed
While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day
I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling please give me a call
Again, thank you for your help with these issues.Regards,Ben
