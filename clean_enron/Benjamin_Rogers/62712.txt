Thanks for the reply!
I will be driving to Austin Friday morning and 9:00 am looks like a good time to meet
My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) and an Admissions interview
I would appreciate it if you could send me your office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday
Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me
Look forward to meeting you.Ben Rogers
