Dave:Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with Tractebel
He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the assets
I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week
He sounded a little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed interested in the assets
Hope this helps
Ben
