Stuart:I m heading into a peaker meeting at 9:00, but will be out in 30 minutes or so
I talked to Jerry this morning and the best time to talk with him is this morning before 10:00 our time
Let s try and talk with him about the remaining issues this morning so we can work on them from our end to eventually talk with him later today
Thanks!Ben
