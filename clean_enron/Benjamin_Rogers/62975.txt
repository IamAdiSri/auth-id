Mike:Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan
These guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput
These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development
Their only operational plants are in Colorado
They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines
If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines
Hope this helps.Ben
