Just wanted to let you know that I received an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who at this point is in charge of my application
He wants me to answer a few questions, making sure I will be able to handle the MBA coursework
That was one of my main reasons for meeting with you and the Professors Ronn and Brown, is to talk to you about the course work and inform you of my strengths and weaknesses, to make sure I could do the work
I know that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background and the Business School s team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in this learning environment
I will convey this message and others to him by tomorrow
I hope things workout and thanks again for your help.Ben
