Have you noticed where Cin Summer is trading lately???
Thats right around $37.5 to $38.0 That is lower than where it liquedated last summer and based on the fundamentals regarding gas, it looks like its heading lower than that by April
Just wanted to keep you well informed and hope that your guys were in the right position
It was a pretty violent price move these last several weeks
Hope all is going well and I ll talk to you soon.Ben
