Good to hear from you!
It s been a while
I am also going to work for another year
My undergrad grades were what held me back
I have already enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer
How Fun!
I am also retaking the GMAT
But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in
Megan will is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY
So I will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer
Would you be interested in going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf
They have some fantastic courses
Other than that - work is going really well and Enron stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is great for future job opportunities
I m playing a lot of tennis, golf anf basketball as of late and its been quite fun
Hope all is going well and lets get together when you get back
See ya soon.Ben
