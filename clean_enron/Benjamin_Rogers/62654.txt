Yes still in Texas, but thinking about moving back up East to New York
I have applied to B-School so I m waiting to here from them
What a process this has been!
I have talked to Mike G. a couple times lately and we were thinking about trying to get alot of people together probably in the spring sometime
We ll see how that goes
Hope all is going well and next time lets keep in touch sooner
