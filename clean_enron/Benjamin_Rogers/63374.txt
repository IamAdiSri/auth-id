John:With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in these cost figures - everything is expensed
With respects to the Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up approximately 50% of the cost
The rest is attributable to energy costs
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year
Please let me know if you have any other comments
Thanks!Ben
