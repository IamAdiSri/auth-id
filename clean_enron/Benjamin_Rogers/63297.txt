Hey Dan:Just wanted to drop you a line
I hadn t talked to you in quite some time and wanted to see how everything was going
I had lunch today with my friend, Andrew Slocum, who I think you know
He talked to his good friend Adam Wexslur (sp) and said things were going well with the paper
He told me that everything seemed to be going great and that the paper has been out on print for a little while now
It sounds great!
Please let me know how everything is going, because I think its awesome what your doing
Hope to talk to you soon.Ben
