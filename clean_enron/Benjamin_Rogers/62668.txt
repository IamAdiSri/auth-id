I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School s application on Thursday, so they received it on Friday
Megan and I are thinking about going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin
Megan has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun
Let me know
If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at Texas that would be greatly appreciated
ThanksBen
