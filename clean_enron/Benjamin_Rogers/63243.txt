Thanks for your quick reply
With regards to the classes, I looked into U of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer classes
The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the University of St. Thomas
It would have been nice to take these classes at U of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there
Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.Regards,Ben
