Rosanna:This most recent year I was in the power trading group for Enron working in the Northeast market, where I was a junior trader, but doing alot of senior trader type stuff
I would be interested in talking with those guys if they are looking for someone like myself
I know that most of the senior traders are staying with UBS
There are a couple who have been looking elsewhere, some I think with Goldman
Let me see where those guys are at
I will send you my resume when I get home, so you will see it come through my home e-mail
