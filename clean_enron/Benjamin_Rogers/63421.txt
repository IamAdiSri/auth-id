Hey:Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for Thanksgiving
Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters
M&M s wedding was fun, saw some people I haven t seen since college - pretty scary
If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get together
I will work on that when the time comes
Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with all this contesting
How is everything going?
What are you guys doing for the holiday?
Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver Creek - I m praying for powder
Again, I hope all is going well and I ll be better next time about getting back to you
Good to hear from you!Ben
