First of all, I am going to run the NYC Marathon and kick both of your asses
Lets put a little wager on this
I headed to the Final Four this weekend and for a little opening day at Cinergy Field to see Ken G. knock some homers
A lot is going on with work and I m also trying to figure out about grad school
I potentially have an offer to go work at an investment bank in NYC (Merrill and CSFB) Need to figure this out soon
Those pictures looked great from Bahrain and those other places
Hope all is going well and keep in touch
See yaBen
