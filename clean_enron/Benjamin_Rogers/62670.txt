I m trying to find good in this announcement but not much is coming from it
I did have a good interview at Duke Business School last week
I should be hearing from NYU-Stern and Duke in the next couple of weeks
What is my next option?
Any suggestions regarding writing letters to anyone you know at Duke or NYU?
Ben
