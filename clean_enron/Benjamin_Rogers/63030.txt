Amy:Here are my answers to your questions:1
Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide audience with this advertisement
2
I don t think the contest should be limited to just these schools/conferences
You probably should open it up to all schools to get an even wider reach of potential candidates.3
I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.4
Please let me know if I can support you in any way.ThanksBen Rogers3-7998
