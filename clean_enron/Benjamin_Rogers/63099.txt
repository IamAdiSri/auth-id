Ran into Ed this morning and he said that he ran into your ugly ass this past weekend
I told him that it sucks for him but its over so all the better
He said he was taking notes from the way you dress, thats if he ever went back to being single again
Biked, ran and workedout this weekend
I am on the path to kicking ass and taking names
Bring it!
