It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts
I got some really good feedback from all the people I talked with
I think that UT would be a good fit for what I m trying to do afterwards - with there energy-finance concentration and investment fund
Plus it would be fun living in Austin for a couple of years
When your in Houston next time wh can grab some drinks and go to dinner
Talk to you soon.Ben
