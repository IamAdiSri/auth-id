I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating # s and cost numbers as well
When I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that these are not "normal" operating assumptions
Please give me a call if you have any questions.Ben
