Mr. Pushaw:Whats up my friend
It s been a long while-too long
The last time I saw you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian rest
I ve been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout
How s everything at law school going?
Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?
I may be in NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia
I m down here in Houston working with Enron
It s been a great experience but I m ready to go back to school to get my MBA
Please give me a call when you have some time and lets catch up
My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738
Hope all is going well and talk to you soon
See yaBen
