Ben:I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano model for a little while now
I walked Miguel through what I had done and how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and what you have said in the past
I also gave them the numbers that the desk has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle case (5 year number)
From this they have modeled and graphed these different scenarios
I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at this time
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions
ThanksBen3-7998
