Just wanted reiterate my comments on Raul and his skills fitting in with what you guys are looking for
I really think he would be a good long term in the corp. dev area and/or investor relations
Let me know if your around for lunch this week at Ninfa s. I m meeting up with Andrew sometime this week as well, maybe we can make it the same day
Let me know.Ben
