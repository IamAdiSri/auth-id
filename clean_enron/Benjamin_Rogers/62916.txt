Hey, sorry its been a little while but I ve been traveling and keeping some late hours on these generation projects
With regards to UT, I am going to stay at Enron for another year
I feel that the thing that hurt me from getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades
So I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer and re-apply next year
Actually, I ll apply to Columbia this Sept to get into their January program, which goes for a year and half
So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer
Talk to you soon.Ben3-7998
