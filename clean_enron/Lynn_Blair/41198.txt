OK, here is what I have: For Wednesday, September 12 - Cynthia and Renee (NGPL) (2 tickets) For Wednesday, September 12 - Robert and Duke (2 tickets) For Thursday, September 13 - Bert and Texaco (4 tickets) Cynthia I am assuming you only wanted 2 tickets
If that is not correct let me know and we can give one of you the 12th and the other a later game
Thanks
