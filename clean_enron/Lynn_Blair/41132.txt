Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement group which needs to be read for PPA s to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers: MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147) IES - 87 stations Interstate Power - 6 stations Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send us updates on the following information ASAP: 1
Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October
2
How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding 3
Provide status of November chart information
Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time frame for the first prior period run
This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices
As you find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know
This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts
We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing
If you have any questions, please let Rick or I know
Thanks
Lynn
