Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for themorning meeting: The report is completed for all information except: Storage Operational Capacity Current and Accum ImbalancesThe group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information available and the report completed by June 15, 2001
The above referencedfields have been a challenge to get the data base populated as needed
But thisgroup has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and notgiving up on possibilities.As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the reportand we have changed how we report outages and allocations
Storage willchange once the new report is completed
Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful toensure we get the product we need
If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the newreport before June 15th, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
