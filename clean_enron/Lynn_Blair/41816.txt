Since we are all moving at different times, we have declared this week to be "causal week" to accomodate cleaning out files, desk, etc
The more we clean out now, the easier it will be to move to our final destination
We appreciate everyone s efforts to accomodate the move as best we can
Please let Donna, Sheila, Rick, Steve, Brad or I know if you have any questions
Thanks
Lynn
