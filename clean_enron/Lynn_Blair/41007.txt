Shelley, do you still want the report Terry is doing each Monday for the TW SOCAL and West of Throeau numbers
We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations so we could track any possible "holes" in the pipe
So far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report unless you need it for Stan s meeting?
Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes
Thanks
Lynn
