An update on our change for the Storage Allocation
Several questionshave come up over the weekend
The weekend crew is documenting thequestions
I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail messageto research the questions and concerns on Monday
Then we will group withstorage and determine what changes need to be made.One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is tobe able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage
ie, if we areallocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS
If we are allocatingwithdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS
Mike Bodnar willpursue this enhancement further
Thanks
