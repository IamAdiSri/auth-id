I would like to remind everyone it is very critical that we send out accurate invoices to our customers
It is our responsibility to review the reports ahead of time (Measurement, Preliminaries, etc)
I feel very strongly that we should NOT be taking comp days on critical accounting days
As I have stated in previous memos this is mainly, reservation close day, the day before commodity close and commodity close day
You should also be considerate of your team when scheduling vacation around these days and ensure you have SPECIFIED proper back up
It is still your responsibility to ensure your invoices are properly reviewed and sent out whether you are in the office or not
If you have any questions, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
