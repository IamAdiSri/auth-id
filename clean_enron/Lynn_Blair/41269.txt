In talking with Delaine today, the date has changed for Oneok to come to Houston
They are now looking at August 27 or 28th
Mary, does that work for you at all?
Is everyone in the office those two days?
I will be in the office Monday morning, August 6, so let me know and then I will coordinate with Delaine
Thanks
Lynn
