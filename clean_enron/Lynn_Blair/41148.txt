Glen, I had a conversation with Pat Davidson (SoCal) yesterday
Things have been going smoothly, because SoCal has not been calling any OFO days
She felt like we would not have an issue until spring and at that time, there is an expectation that SoCal could be calling more OFOs
We agreed to continue talking, but that does not resolve the issue completely
Thanks
