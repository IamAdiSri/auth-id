I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation
Some of the questions being asked: 1
Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?
2
Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW s primary firm?
3
What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?
I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well
We are looking at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m
Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you
Then we will get a room and let everyone know date and time
Thanks
Lynn
