Jodie and Raetta, I am giving a presentation to Measurement to review Gas Logistic s functions and interactions with other departments
I would like for both of you to attend this meeting if possible
The meeting will be November 14, 2001 at 1:00 p.m. Gary, I am assuming you are getting a room in the Three Allen Center?
Please let me know if you would like to get a room in the Enron Building
Thanks
Lynn
