Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?
Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who
Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton, you DO double your MDQ
Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet
Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?
If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract
If I have confused you, let s discuss
Thanks
