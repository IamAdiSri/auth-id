I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do s" from the meeting yesterday
1
After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS
2
Measurement would check to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process
(Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done)
3
Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS
(We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system)
4
Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG
5
Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be "housed in PGAS
After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number
If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen: 1
Measurement should either: a
Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS
b
Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info
2
If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point
Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic
I would be glad to regroup if you want
I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue
Also Raetta and Jodie are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS
Hopefully it is just a measurement error
We will let you know the outcome
If there is something I missed, please let me know
Thanks
