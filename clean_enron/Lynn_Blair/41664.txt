Terry, Maggie and Sheila, if you get comfortable with the direction these emails are going, then we do NOT need to meet
Let me know if you feel like we need to group together to finalize this issue and be sure we are on the same page
Otherwise, I would ask that Maggie or Hasan do a final results email and let us know what the outcome is
Thanks for everyone s help on getting this issue behind us
