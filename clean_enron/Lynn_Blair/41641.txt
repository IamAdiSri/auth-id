We rely on the information from the Process Responsibility meeting to post weekend coverage to the WEB
The coverage is posted by Tuesday morning on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers
Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting
You should have the right information going into Monday s meeting
It does not look good to continually repost this information
If you have any questions, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
