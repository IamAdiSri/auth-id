I do not understand this schedule
Where is Diana and Renee in the evenings?
Also can you give me the schedule for the weekends now that you have Diana and Renee on the weekends?
Plus I would like to know what customers you gave Diana and Renee from a scheduling perspective and what you took away from them from an accounting perspective to even the workloads
Could one of you schedule some time with me and John to review the above questions?
Thanks
