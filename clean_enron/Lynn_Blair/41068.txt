I want to remind everyone when NNG calls on the Carlton Resolution, we can NOT allow ANY deliveries at Carlton
At each cycle, please be sure you monitor any deliveries at Carlton and let Steve, Gary or Darrell know if you see any nominations
At that point Carlton Deliveries should be allocated to zero (0)
If you have any questions, or we need to discuss further, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
