I am concerned we will have/or should have some of the frank discussions we have with AA setting in the room
Is there anyway we could have a rooster everyone signs to show we attended if that is all they are concerned about?
Just a thought
I can live with either decision, but I want to prep my people before the meeting if AA attends
Thanks
