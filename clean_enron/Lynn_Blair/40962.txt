Bob, you are correct in your statement
But I want to be sure Koch understand when they nominate their receipt at Carlton of 2828 the delivery on that path will be 2828 less fuel
Otherwise I agree with you statements
I will be out next week, but Raetta is up to speed on this issue if you have any questions
Thanks
