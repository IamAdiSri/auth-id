The accounting/Market Service SGA conference is being held this year in New Orleans on September 26 - 28
I would like for each team to pick a candidate to attend this meeting
If you attended last year, it would be good to give someone else an opportunity this year to attend
A few of the highlights of the conference are: Internet Billing presentation and discussion Presentation on electric deregulation Natural Gas Prices Challenges and issues for electric scheduling and accounting Please let me know who you candidate will be by Monday, August 27
If you have any questions about the conference, you can give me, Larry or Raetta a call
Thanks
Lynn
