We can make the meeting Thursday afternoon if that is better for you guys
It will be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss
Rick, FYI, Shelley postponed her meeting until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting
Possible means they do not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wanted to give us a "heads up" from a system perspective
Hopefully that helps
See ya ll in the morning
Thanks
