Ranelle, John and Michelle, thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question
The question is: How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e
nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac) For Nominating purposes: MDQ of contract Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ
Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate
Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point
EXAMPLE: If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ
Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ
Anything over will be overrun at IT rate
If anyone has any other questions, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
