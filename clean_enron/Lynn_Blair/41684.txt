Ava, please get Jo and I some dates for giving the Marketers a "Brown Bag" training session on Nomination, Confirmation and Scheduling process
I would like to use the video Room on 42 in Houston and 6th floor in Omaha
I would like to look at the week of October 15th
The session could be a brown bag from 11:30 to 1:00
John Buchanan and I can give the presentation since Terry will be out that week
Thanks
Lynn
