Tim, I would like for us to discuss this issue
Normally we do not "settle" on these type of issues
I want to be consistent with how we have treated other shippers when we have found errors in the system
Doesn t mean we can t do a settlement, we just don t want it to back fire on us
Ava, please set up some time on Thursday for Tim, Mike, Bob, Sue and I to visit
Thanks
