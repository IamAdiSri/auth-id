Mike, thanks for the update
I have a couple of questions/comments: 1
Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?
2
Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement list
I like the idea of automating the last bullet
I am not sure if it is in CMS or elsewhere, but I would like to be sure we pursue this automation
Thanks
