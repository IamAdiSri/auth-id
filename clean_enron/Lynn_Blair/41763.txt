Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend
For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning
Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow
System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. Saturday morning
On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update
Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore most of the gas is staying in the east market
Thanks
Lynn
