Shelley, FYI
These are some of the comments and requests we get about people attending the meeting
Normally since Duke is in town and Duke and Robert have an opportunity to meet here, we usually do not sent those reps to the Winter Ops meeting
However, a lot is going on with Duke right now and it might be very beneficial for us to go ahead and send Robert
I ll review the list with you before we make a final decision on who goes
Thanks
