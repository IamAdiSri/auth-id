Vernon, the way the accounting system works today: Dec. 1 - 20 flow will be attributed to the contract that nominated at that point for the 21 through 31
This automaticall happens if there is no OBA at the point and if there is only one contract nominated at the point
If we do not want that to happen, we need to discuss our options
Thanks
