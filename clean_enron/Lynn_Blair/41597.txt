Bob, I will be out of the office on Monday, Oct
22nd., but Donna and John can work with Williams and the team to meet on MOPS scheduling
I would like for you to meet with Donna and John before the 22nd to be sure we are comfortable with what information to pass back and forth
John, would you take the lead working with Donna and Bob to cover the meeting on Monday
Thanks
