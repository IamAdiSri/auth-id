Shelley, we had our weekly TW imbalance meeting this morning and I think you will be very pleased next week to see the progress the team has made
They have come up with plans for both the dollar valued and volumetric imbalances
We have ensured the volumetric imbalances have not grown this last week and will continue this effort
TK, Darrell and Dan are bringing suggestions to the table to look at the economics of what the customers are doing
We will continue to monitor throughout this week and weekend and be ready for an update on Tuesday
Hope you both are having a great vacation
See ya next week
Lynn
