Attached is a draft of a letter we are sending to our customers as discussed at the Winter Ops Meeting in September
Also, we have attached a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) document that will go out with the letter and will be posted to the WEB
We will monitor the WEB site and update the questions periodically
Please review the letter and FAQ and let me know of any changes or comments by tomorrow evening, Tuesday, 5:00 p.m. Our goal is to get these documents to the customers by Wednesday, October 3rd
We appreciate your input in this process
Do not hesitate to call if you have questions
