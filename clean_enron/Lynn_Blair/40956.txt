FYI
Wanted to pass on this information
After working with Minnegasco to help them use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday s gas day and changed their business between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2
This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17
We tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers
If you have any questions, please let me know
Thanks
