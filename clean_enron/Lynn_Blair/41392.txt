Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you
On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without a schedule volume to ensure proper billing
Since TBS on NNG do not always have a scheduled volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper
Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?
We certainly would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side
This is especially important for new meters as we go through the billing process
Just a thought
Thanks
