Ava, we have finally made a decision to go with November 8 and 9th, 2001 for the TW Customer meeting
Please work with Donna on the details and let me know if you are not able to get the hotel for that time frame
Donna, it was also suggested we just do the meeting in the Enron building and then go down to Kehma for the boat ride
What do you think of that idea?
Thanks
Lynn
