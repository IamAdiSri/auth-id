Kent and Dave, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting
High level recap is: 130,000 Due to building line pack from Monday s gas day 95,000 Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from the previous day) 140,000 Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF
In looking at LSF, we were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled
It looked to be pretty evenly distributed) 15,000 Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs
_______ 380,000 The total swing was 419,000
The difference of 39,000 is a combination operational adjustments
Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns
If you have any questions, please let me know
Thanks
