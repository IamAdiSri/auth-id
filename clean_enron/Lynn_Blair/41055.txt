Delaine Kurth with Oneok called today and wanted an OBA at the (Skellytown) Cargray Plant (POI 8442) effective 1/1/2002
After talking with Vernon, I told her that we would draft an OBA on Wednesday with Month to Month cash out language in it
She said to send her the contract and she will run the traps
She was not excited about the monthly cash out requirement
I told her if we could come to agreement we would make it effective 1/1/2002
If we could not come to agreement, we would continue the same methodology as we have today, which is Oneok picks one of the transportation contracts at the Cargray tailgate to take any variances
Karen, per our conversation, please draft an OBA to send to Oneok
If anyone has any other thoughts or comments on preparing this OBA, please let Karen or I know
Thanks
Lynn
