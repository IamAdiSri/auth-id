Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?
I had a question from Alliant, "You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation, why can t you schedule more delivery at ANR?
Wouldn t that help the system?"
I think it would be hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all at the same time
What do you guys think?
Thanks
