Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs
Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002
Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team
John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area
Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame Let s discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this
Thanks
Lynn
