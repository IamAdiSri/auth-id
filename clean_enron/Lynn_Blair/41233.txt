I talked with Delaine today to firm up our meeting on the 29th
Here is the plan
11:30 - 12:00 - Lunch in the building (Ava can you get Trebeards) 12:00 - 4:30 - Discuss: Midcontinent Market Center I/C at Bushton Points that are on the wrong OBA Imbalances on the Gathering OBA American Processing Issues (Robert) Let me know if we need to add anything else or have any quetions
I think this will take the majority of the afternoon
Ava, please get us a room (preferrably 4102) for the afternoon
Attendees from Oneok are: Delaine Kurth, Kim Hardman, Sherry Rogers, maybe one other person
Thanks
Lynn
