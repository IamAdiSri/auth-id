I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes coming that we need to discuss in the morning
1
There may be a 10 day lag on pricing 2
The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator calculation
(as well as fuel) 3
We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts
Do you have any time Wed. morning?
What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?
If that doesn t work we can look at tomorrow afternoon
Thanks
Lynn
