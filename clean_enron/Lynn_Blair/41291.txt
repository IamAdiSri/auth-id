I talked to Lisa with ENW and told her I would pass her concern on to the regulatory and marketing group
That seem to make her feel better anyway
We are working with her and other customers as needed to help them through the Timely process for the first
At this time we are not planning on extended the Timely deadline, but we will revisit that decision as we get closer to 11:30
Thanks for everyones support and help
