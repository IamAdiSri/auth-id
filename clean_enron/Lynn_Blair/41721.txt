Shelley, FYI
Drew, Britt and I are meeting with the So
Central Team on Monday, October 1, at 10:00 a.m. for 30 minutes
It is not the best time for everyone, but it was the best way to get the most people and get the meeting ASAP
We will leave a person on the team to cover phones, plus the North end team is going to help watch the phone for that 30 minutes
Thanks
