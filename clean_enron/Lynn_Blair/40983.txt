Greg, following are the questions you asked and my answers

1
Number 4 is still a little fuzzy
Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?
Answer: Yes 2
Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?
Answer: A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation
When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point
The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same cycle
