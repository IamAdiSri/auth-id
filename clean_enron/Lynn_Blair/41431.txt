It was good to get your note
To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully)surgery last Monday, June 18th
Everything went well
I should be back towork on Tuesday, June 26th
I was surprised I did not get postponed with theflooding down in the Medical Center
I stayed over one night and I was sureready to go home the next day
I really felt for those nurses
The hospital(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out theMedthodist and Herman hospitals
Hope all your belongings in storage were OK
I am so glad ya ll did not havemore damage than you did
I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has peoplestarting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh s mom

I would like to send him a card
I had lunchwith him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time withhis Mom
Speaking of parents, how are yours?
Hope they are both doing well.As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.Take care of each other
