I want to thank all of you for your efforts yesterday to help our customers get their business taken care of on the Enron pipes
It looks like we will be in the same mode of operation at least through this morning
Please make every effort to contact your customers and let them know they can get into Hottap through URL: www.hottap.enroncorp.com If they are having problems accessing Hottap, give them the pertinent information they need to do their "next cycle" business (ie
schedule quantity info)
Let s be proactive and help the customers through this frustrating time
I also appreicate everyone staying around until 6:00 last night
It is good to work with a group that is willing to help out where possible
Also, Toby thanks for your "hours" of work on sending out the emails to our customers to let them know what our plans were
Thanks
Lynn
