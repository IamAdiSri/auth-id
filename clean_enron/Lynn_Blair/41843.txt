Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as meeting you
I wanted to let you know ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting
Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend
Please add Theresa on any future emails
Her email address is theresa.hess@enron.com
In talking with Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a cancellation
One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting: is the "mis matches" across interconnecting pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle
This is still a concern for the Enron pipes and I wold like to know if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these mismatches
If you would like to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637
Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21
Thanks
