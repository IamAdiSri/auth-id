John and Terry, could you check into having a Business Objects report done for all groupings with the following information
Previous Cyclce Nomination Current Nomination Confirmation Schedule Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report
The reason for the report - Gas Control needs to know what changes have taken place and this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report
If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know
I would like to be able run this report during cycle
(I think I am probably asking for the moon), but that would be the best time for Gas Control
Thanks
Lynn
