Michelle, it was so good to hear from you
I definitely want to stay in touch
Next time you are in Houston, please let me know and we ll get together
I am glad you are surviving your new earrings
They are a lot of fun once you adjust to them
Those dangling pieces can be tricky!!
Take care and look forward to seeing you in the future
