Shelley, attached is the first draft for the plan to talk with the reps for all three pipes on Wednesday
This will be a two phase approach
We (Sheila, Fran and I) will talk with the teams on Wednesday reviewing a high level plan
Then we will put the teams into groups to talk about 5 topics we picked from the NNG meeting
Then we will follow up with Donna to develop a training plan
Fran and I are meeting again tomorrow (Tuesday) at 3:30 if you want to join us or have comments
Thanks
Lynn
