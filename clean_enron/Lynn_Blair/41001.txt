Just to clarify Britt s comments
Harry is using NNG s numbers for total imbalance
To split the imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok s allocation of actual volumes
The variance between Oneok and NNG will go to the Oneok imbalance to tie to NNG s ultra sonic measurement
Thanks
