Ray, Teb is right.. Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices onJune 1 instead of May 31
At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month
This would be after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectivelycapture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month
Hope I have not confused the issue for you
If you have any other questions, please let me knowThanks
