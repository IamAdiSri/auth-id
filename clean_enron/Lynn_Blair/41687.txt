On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable back to January, 1998
In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very many of these issues
Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts
My expectation is that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will ask Alice for an update
Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in this effort
All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001
