Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK
Thanks
Lynn We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1
Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW: 1
SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems
And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles)
(Good news for TW) 2
SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750
If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems
(Good news for TW) 4
SoCal will have the option to call OFO s at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day
Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins
Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day
(This will be a major impact to SoCal s customers) 5
SoCal says the "windowing" is gone
But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity
6
SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation
This would be due to SoCal s market not burning their schedule
At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn
Overall, our process does not change
If you have any questions, please let me know
Thanks
Lynn
