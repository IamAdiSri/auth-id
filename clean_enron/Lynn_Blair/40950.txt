I will be on vacation Tuesday, November 20 through Monday, November 26
I will be back in the office on Tuesday, November 27th
John and Terry are in the office all week and Terry is on call for the holiday weekend for scheduling issues
Terry and Steve can get a hold of me over the holidays if needed
For accounting issues, Raetta and Larry will be in the office Tuesday and Wednesday, with Raetta taking a half day vacation on Wednesday
All of you have a great Thanksgiving with your families
I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday
