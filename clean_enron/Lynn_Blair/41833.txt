I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01
There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation
I made an assumption everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002
There was still a lot of vacation to be taken
I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00 to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year
We can meet in my office
Thanks
Lynn
