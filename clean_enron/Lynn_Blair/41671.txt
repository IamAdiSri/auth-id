We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week
At this time I think the split is OK
I would like for you to put in writing for me the following: Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out
I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team
This may help us address the issue of the two "old" teams merging
For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other s desk
Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant
Scott and Kathy support each other s desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator
Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps. GPM Monthly Pricing Report Lamar Power Plant True Ups PVR Report Oneok Gathering Reporting NNG Administrative Contracts SPS Power Plant True Up Conoco Power Plant True Up MOPS Daily Report The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows: Duke/GPM Oneok Transcanada Dynegy Reliant ElPaso West Texas Gas If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself
Thanks
Lynn
