Mary and Dari, here is my answer
Are you comfortable with it before I send it to the shipper
Thanks
Lynn Answer: If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1 cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes
Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the operator of the point
Therefore, they would not encounter a DDVC penalty
If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines if a DDVC is appropriate
The DDVC is based on the difference between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point
If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call
