On TW, TW allocated SoCal on the ID2 cycle for Sunday s gas day, due to SoCal non performance
We cut about 27,000 mmbtu
The Sequel 2000 conversion on the reports went well
Brad s team was here to help Sunday morning and I believe that made things go smoother
There were a few isolated situations which were turned around quickly
Otherwise it was quiet on the pipes
Thanks
