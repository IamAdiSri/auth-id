We finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 dth Carlton Obligation
KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward
We told KN that they will have a penalty of $25.00 per dth for each day they did not nominate
18 dth x 25.00 $450/day x 3 days $1350
We also told them we have been leaving messages since Saturday
We left messages at 3 different offices
KN admitted to seeing the posting but "did not understand" the obligation and they did not call for clarification
If you have any questions, please let John (Ext
7429) or I (Ext
7637) know
Thanks
Lynn
