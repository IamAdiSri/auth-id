Attached is the action form HR has indicated we are to use for Level 3 performer
This form will be in addition to the PEP system Peformance review form
In discussions with Shelly we will use the form for all Level 3, but ONLY input "target dates" for those employees with issues
Thought I would pass it on and let you modify as you need for your reviews
If I have throughly confused you, give me a call
Thanks
Lynn
