I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon
I wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us whatever freedom we want with the ship
I m not sure we should kill ourselves for a few pennies--I d even let the ship stay empty and maybe force some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a spot market
Maybe EOL
Any thoughts?Jeff
