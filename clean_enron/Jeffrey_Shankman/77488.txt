Print on my business letterhead.Naomi LeffNaomi Leff & Associates12 West 27th StreetNew York, NY 10001212 686 6300Dear Naomi,Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home
I ve enclosed a virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my architect
If there is anything else you need, please call anytime
I m excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover my passion for 20th century design
Dennis and Daniel have been a great source of the best objects and knowledge
Of course it is a primary concern to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work together.Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that results from that attention.Best Regards,Jeff
