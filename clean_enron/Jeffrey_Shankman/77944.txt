Please print following on letterhead:Larry KellnerChief Financial Officer(put rest here)Dear Larry,Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks
I ve asked Mark Tawney, Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge research
We didn t have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but I d be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship
If there is anything else I can do, please call
It s great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier
Again thanks for your time.Regards,
