I ll get on it
With the Texaco Chevron merger, I d like to get some insight into their organizations
Particularly Texaco, since they have two trading offices, one in Whit Plains, the other here
This set up for them has never worked well, and I d like to talk to some of the better Texaco traders, if there are any
