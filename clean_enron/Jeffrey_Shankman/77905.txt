WHERE are my macadamias?
Did you break the scales at the doctor?
Do you know how funny I am?
I m finally leaving for the evening, and I m so psyched to go home and play fetch with myself with the glow in the dark ball!
Have a great weekend if I don t talk to you during the hour I ll be here in the morn....Hugs to Emma
