As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates
As you know, Enron has committed over $1million during the next four years to University of Pennsylvania, and Wharton
I want to make sure we don t limit ourselves in getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number of summer employees
I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer
In fact, I d like to be as aggressive as possible
I am operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs
I will not accept the notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.In addition, I m concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift certificates is viewed as good one
I m not sure that is a good use of Enron s dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends.Jeff
