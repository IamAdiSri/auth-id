No doubt about drinks with you being more fun!
(My haircut is perfect, you ll be pleased to know) I did go out with my neighbors last night--I needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st. came over last night and backed out of his contract
Boy was I annoyed
And still am, but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me
So I m going to take out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back
Want to go?
I m thinking Tony s or something else fun/festive
To be determined...but fun
