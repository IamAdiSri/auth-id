Your thoughts are dead on
Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products
Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage
Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage
(We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)
Proceed, but I m not sure about the JV with ENA issue
