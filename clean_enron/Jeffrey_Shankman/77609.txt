I don t know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder s getting shorter 2186 contracts of crude and Botchlett s getting shorter 2141 heat contracts
Don s Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave s Var went down only 687 thousand to 3.1 million
Where is Dave s var coming from?We need to be under our Var tonight
Dave and Don--please take care of this
Jeff
