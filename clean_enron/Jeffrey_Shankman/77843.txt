Good afternoon Ida (better name for you than me)
EC was uneventful, given that I wore no crazy hat
At the right time though
I know the party will be great--try not to stress too much, besides your plans sounded great and I m sure everyone will have a great time
I m leaving in a little while to go to the closing ( and collect some cash!
), and am out the rest of the afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile!
In case you were wondering, I used almost a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it
Ideas?
