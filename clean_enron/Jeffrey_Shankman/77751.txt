I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in the financial commit
from us
He was not receptive, and in the past, I ve suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing their broadband needs
Others here have thought about this at Enron (like the California University system)
Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run with this in a more direct approach and see what happends
(Tom P. was open to all of this, of course).FYI, thanks
Jeff
