Thanks for the email
Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of Joe
He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has added much value to our organization
I was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position
I would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked
In addition, I could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products
(Which I will remind you about frequently)I m sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as well
Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both respect your business sense.As far as the guilt thing goes, I can t help you
I m Jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.Jeff
