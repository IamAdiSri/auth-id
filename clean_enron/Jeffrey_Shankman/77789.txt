Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec
committee members, I ll take the Analyst/Associate program
We ve been incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn , and I d like to replicate our approach company wide
I m convinced with my help, we can do a world class job
I d be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring, and other ways to improve the entire process (internal and external) around Enron
Thanks
Jeff
