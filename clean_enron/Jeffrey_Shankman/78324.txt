Hi Thor, Sorry you won t make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing
I do have a question about Bjarne s promotion to director
When I look at the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and I don t think that deserves this promotion
What else does he do?
I m also concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this
His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I d like to get this cleared up
Jeff
