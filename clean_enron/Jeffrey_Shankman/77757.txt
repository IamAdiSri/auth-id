Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping, etc
has great possibility for Enron
I d like to get a group of people to talk about plans going forward, and will fill you in shortly on time, where, etc
One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it being cleared through public relations first
Your comments were interesting, but I was concerned about perception
Please coordinate public statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going forward
Thanks
Jeff
