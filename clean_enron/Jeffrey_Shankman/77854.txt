I m not happy today
Going back to last night, I got home, fell asleep on the couch in the new house, went upstairs at 4, and slept til 830
Late all day, and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and Jeff Skilling
I can t describe the weight of the world feeling I have, and I m not good at not being in control
I wish I had the answers.How are you?
