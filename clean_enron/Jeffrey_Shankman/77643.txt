Thanks for the thought
We are trying to get more fund business already through Per in the NY office
Do you have any funds you d like to sign up
In terms of products, I was thinking more depth in products we feel comfortable managing
Maybe different spreads/cracks, whatever
You can control product launch, not the funds
Can you give a some ideas of more/new products we trade or more/new products you d like to get on eol
What more products will your customers want?
