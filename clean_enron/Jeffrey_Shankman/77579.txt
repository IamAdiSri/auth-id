Mark, Thor, and Todd,Thanks for the video conference this morning
Mike and I are convinced weather can and will be an extremely profitable business
One issue I would like to address is EnergyDesk.com
It seems like an interesting idea, but I d like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in doing in NetWorks
I d also like to understand more about the scalability of this model, and our relationship with Kiodex
To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com
I will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues
RegardsJeff
