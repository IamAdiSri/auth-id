What do you think of this:As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader s Roundtable
The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of the markets we manage
In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron s businesses, and promote aggressive ideas
Each week, we ll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion
Your input is valuable, and we ve limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321
