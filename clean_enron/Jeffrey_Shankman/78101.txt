Thanks for all your help with Sempra
Hard work, but certainly worth it
On another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR
Bottom line, we are not taking this hit
It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them
Thanks
Jeff
