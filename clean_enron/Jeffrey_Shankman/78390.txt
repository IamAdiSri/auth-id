Very different hotels
It is one of Paris palace hotels right in the middle of of the city
(near vendome and concorde area) very central to all of paris
costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations
Big lobby, lots of gold, etc
Great, but not as cool/hip as costes
How s London and the marketing of the 24/7 product?
