I went to mia bella--and I think i m with you on the dont like it thought
I thought i was going to hurl on my hardwoods last night
crashed about 10:30pm
I figure you all could come over for a glass of wine first (and I can show ms tobor the house) then head over
My flight is at 9:40 pm tonight, and I haven t packed yet
Unless you have another idea??????????
