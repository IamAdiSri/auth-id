Candidly, Mark wanted to leave it open as to whom it would report
He wanted to have control in it s growth and staffing, although it would be coordinated with Thor
Mark (and I) talked to Thor about this a while ago, and will begin weekly video calls in the new year about strategy, updates, new products, and growing this business continentally
(Mark was still concerned about the members of the Oslo weather group that Thor managed poorly--in Mark s mind)
I m sure we will get to a point that works best organizationally with Thor having a role
However, when you look at the P&L of the business, is doesn t illustrate his support of the business, which we are addressing
