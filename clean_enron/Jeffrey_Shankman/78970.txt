Thanks for the note
You have no idea how awful this is
I hope no one I know (like) ever has to go through this.I m thinking about making the dragofly table a gift to the MFA, Houston, where is was just exhibited for 2 months in the Defining Modern show
What would you appraise the value as?
(Approximately, and of course I know it s not anything close to a fomal apprasail?)
Also, I ve had 2 people approach me about selling it outright
