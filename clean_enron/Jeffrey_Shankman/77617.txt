It seems to me we are in the middle of no man s land with respect to the following: Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy (?
), and no real weather anywhere in the world
I think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively
I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature
Given that, and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a problem, let s be as flat as possible
I m ok with spread risk (not front to backs, but commodity spreads)
The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don t have a real feel for everyone s passion with respect to the markets
As such, I d like to ask John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon
and Wed
Thanks
Jeff
