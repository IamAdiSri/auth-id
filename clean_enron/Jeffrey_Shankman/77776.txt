As I was packing some books this weekend, I stumbled across an old copy of The Story of O, and almost fell over
I knew I had heard of that book--I must have read it some time ago--I think it was orig published in 1954 or 1965
Now I remember how much I didn t like it!
Hope you ve recovered from all your parties
How was the book dinner
Did I mention I had a spur of the moment party last night?
