Cool
They sell their music CD s at the front desk
They may even have two out
Would you mind picking them up for me?
I ll pay you back, I promise
If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the hotel--it s great
Also try to get a room overlooking the interior courtyard, and don t change money at the hotel--they ll bend you as only the french can
Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel.Jeff.PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a briefcase?--they re about $5,000 or so
Great, thanks
