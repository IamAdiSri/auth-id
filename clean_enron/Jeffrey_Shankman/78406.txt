Michelle,Thanks for the quick turnaround on the draft contract for Dan Reck
Mark Frevert, Mike Mcconnell and I had several conversations today about this issue
I have left a detailed voice mail for Mark outlining the target amounts, and will wait to hear back from him (by tomorrow) before presenting this to Dan.Regards,Jeff
