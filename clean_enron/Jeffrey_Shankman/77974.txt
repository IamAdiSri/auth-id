Since only I know I m not trying to offend you, that s all I can say
I m not sure I m worthy of your being concerned either (I don t deserve it--I d guess) You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while
I don t know what to say, and I m sure I m embarrassed by this whole thing--most particularly how I ve handled our relationship
I really want to see you, but I need some time to myself I guess
I do know glen doesn t have all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only one these days
My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go
