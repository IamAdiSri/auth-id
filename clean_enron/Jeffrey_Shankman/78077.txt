The US/UK Arbitrage book, the Finland Arbitrage book, and the Products Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down, and no positions are authorized to go into those books going forward
In addition, all positions in those books must be pulled out as of today, and I want them removed from the P&L reports I get.Also, we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour, 4 cent wide EOL crude market
Thanks
Jeff
