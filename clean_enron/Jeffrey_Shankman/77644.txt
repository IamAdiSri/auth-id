I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated
The problem with the P&L loss is one of time
We have given back 25 million this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time
I expect traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints
I d be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year
Of course spread trading is a good idea, but when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I m being told doesn t make sense
We ll get there
