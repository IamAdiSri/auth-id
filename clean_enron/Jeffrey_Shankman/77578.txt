Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to come to his group
I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, and wanted to catch up with you on this matter
I ll give you a ring by week s end if we want to proceed
My initial reaction is that it probably makes sense....Jeff
