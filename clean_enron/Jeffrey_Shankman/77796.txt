Of course I want to get together next (this?)
weekend
In fact, the house should be almost done, and I d love to show it to you, too
I m pretty open also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow)
Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity balls, social scene, etc
So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show
I made everyone wear Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of champagne (as much as possible!)
Fun, casual, and last minute
For not being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun
Went to my first exec committee meeting
Pretty interesting
