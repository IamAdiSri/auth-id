As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers
(In a nutshell, what can go where) Can I get this ASAP?
Thanks Jeff
