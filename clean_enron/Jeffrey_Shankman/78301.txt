Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r
people with respect to robin menear
she was listed as commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a commercial manager
Your boy Brad McSherry didn t fix her class, even though this was a problem at mid year as well
Of course he told me it had been taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history, and what my intent was when i hired her
he too was involved in the hiring decision.Shall i do brad s termination, or will you
