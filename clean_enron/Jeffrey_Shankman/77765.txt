Hi, hope you are doing great
I was wondering if you ve met Russell Dyke, who is in Lagrasta s group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you came over
He has great international experience, and LNG experience
He might be a great match with the Jose team, since I m uncomfortable with their understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of doing business
(Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with CSFB worth 19 million to us.)
Overall a solid guy
Let me know what you think
(Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on projects together)Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, possibly to trade freight, etc
