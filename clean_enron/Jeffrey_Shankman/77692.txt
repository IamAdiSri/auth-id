No thoughts on Skilling s speech
He just needs to emphasize we are a great productive entrepreneurial company
Any we re are largest energy trading and risk management house in the world
It would be ok if he mentioned that I am a Wharton 89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group
Students like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world
(By the way, I m the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad)
This speech he is giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit...On another note, I have an idea for you
