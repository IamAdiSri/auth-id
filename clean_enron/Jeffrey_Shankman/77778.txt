As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this business unit
This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position management from a worldwide perspective
Our ability to gather data and to show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success
As important is one pricing desk
Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group
To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention
ALL LNG contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, etc
), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker
It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion
We all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our businesses.RegardsJeff
