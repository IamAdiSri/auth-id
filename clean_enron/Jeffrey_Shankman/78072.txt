What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the Dhabol supply contract?
That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if necessary
Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful
Thanks
