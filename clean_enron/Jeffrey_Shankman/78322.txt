Jeff, I understand you ve been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders for some of your transportation work
Please do not go directly to the traders, rather the structuring desk
Also, please coordinate your activites with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and rail issues
We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of the customers you ve pitched
In most cases, we have been covering many of these customers from the energy side already.Thanks for your cooperationJeff
