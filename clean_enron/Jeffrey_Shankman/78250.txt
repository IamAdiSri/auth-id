Thanks for the update on the sell weekend
It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives
Going forward, I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar recruiting functions
I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend
We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it
I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend
If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all responsibility going forward
I appreciate everyone s support and cooperation.Jeff
