Hi Dave
As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8)
See how that looks on the calendar for y all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland
(I did go to the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat my group gave me--pictures to follow)Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?Jeff "J. R." Shankdaddy
