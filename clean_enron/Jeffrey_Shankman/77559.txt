Thanks for the note
We are still looking at the value chain, but think we may have an idea
I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we were in London
Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much for us, and is probably the wrong way to run that group
Interestingly, the cargill CEO hasn t met with us yet
We have been trading softs, but very small
Next time Gary Hickerson is in London, which should be soon, I ll have him give you guys the story, and ask for more of your input
