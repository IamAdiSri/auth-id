I understand, however, each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader
Ok if you want to take over arb books, but they (positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader) must be managed without the team approach of books prior
The 1 million Var applies to the line next to Ross s name on the p&l sheets
I don t know how many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross
If ross get s bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap
Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around
