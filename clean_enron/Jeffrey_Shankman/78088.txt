Thanks for the update
In the US we have a non conforming DASH (Deas Approval SHeet) that has to be signed by either Mike or me regardless of commitment
I d like you, Brent and Alan to determine the best way to standardize US and Europe DASH processes
Mike or I will sign all EGM business worldwide
Thanks
