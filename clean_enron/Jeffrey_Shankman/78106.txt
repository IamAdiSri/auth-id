I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business
Further to this, I d like to ask again how I can get access to VAR (I believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily)
Is this a Board question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?
On another note, I ve been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues
