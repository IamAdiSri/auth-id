I m not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre)
However, we have to look at our internal and external options
If you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron
In fact it appears to be quite one-sided
First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne)
Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities
Third, execute
I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I d like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.Thanks
