Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see # s)
I don t think it s appropriate to shut down anything
We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market
We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.Am I making sense?
In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks)
We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.With respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage
