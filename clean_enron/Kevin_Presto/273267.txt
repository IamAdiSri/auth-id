You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site
They have 4 custom builders (Tom Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and Tom Hale)
They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris.I have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative
It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house
