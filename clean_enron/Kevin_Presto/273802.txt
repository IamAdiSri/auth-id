Why can t we use AEP s position against them in their own backyard (Ohio)
AEP s position is that you can t have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP s service territory in Ohio.Can we use their own testimony against them?
