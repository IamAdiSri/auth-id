Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist
The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years)
Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003
