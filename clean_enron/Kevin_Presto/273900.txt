I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore
The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.I can t imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate
I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate
I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well
One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.Kevin PrestoEast Power TradingPhone: 713-853-5035Cell: 713-854-3923Fax: 713-646-8272
