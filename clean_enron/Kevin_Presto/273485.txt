I am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week
It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract, so that is my challenge for the hourly group
Having said that, I concur with your suggestions.I am assuming you are presenting Narsima and Edith there promotion and contract packages
Please confirm
