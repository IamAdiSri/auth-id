Can I hire Martin Lin back into Netco from the estate
He has provided valuable transmission & dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group (he worked for Vince in Research)
We have lost Anna Santucci to CMS and this would not change our headcount in the fundies group.Additionally, if I was forced to cut additional bodies, most of the cuts would likely come from real-time (3), options (2), regional trading (2), logistics (1-2).For Martin s planning purposes, I need to know something ASAP
Thanks
