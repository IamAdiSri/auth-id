Wisconsin s offer is a joke
Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I m assuming you understand the difference)
We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long
This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value
I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate
We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02
I would accept nothing less than $1.2 million
