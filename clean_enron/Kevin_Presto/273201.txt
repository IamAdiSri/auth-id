I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don t pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k
This is pretty easy math for me.I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now
I would like to get this done ASAP.Thanks
