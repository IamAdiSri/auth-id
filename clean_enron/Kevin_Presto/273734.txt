I am getting more like you every day
Given what s going on in EES right now, I don t trust anyone
Therefore, I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with
Obviously, this includes Dale
With respect to the rest of the EES group, I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron s shareholders
