In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it s effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate
It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate
Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly
