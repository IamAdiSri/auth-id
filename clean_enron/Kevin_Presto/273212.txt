We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation
Therefore, we don t need to proceed with the diesel installation.I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx
100-150 MW)
This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems
We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.thanks
