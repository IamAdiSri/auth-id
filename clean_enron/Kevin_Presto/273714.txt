You have the right Kevin Presto
I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years
I currently oversee the company s power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US
Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and Enron s culture in general.How are you doing?
I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years
I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless wedding (85-86?)
if my memory is correct.Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron?
