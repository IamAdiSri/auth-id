Chemistry is very important to me and I am rewarding Carson for his loyalty and "low maintenance"
In addition, he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year
Mike (working for Fletch) is very capable and will do a great job for us in the SE
Eric Saibi will come over from ERCOT and run the cash books in the SE
I will be happy to talk Marcello to see if there is another fit
