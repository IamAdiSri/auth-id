Are you a mind reader
I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc
In attendance will be: Berney Busby Don Black Rogers Herndon Jay Lewis Joe Wagner Narsima Misra Jubran WhalanI recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon)
I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst s to schedule time and location
