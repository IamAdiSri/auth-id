Greg,My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching (currently a biology teacher at Richland High School) into something where performance is rewarded.He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive
Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys?
I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry.I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle, so I m not sure if you need people or not
Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume.Hope everything is going well for you and your family.Thanks
