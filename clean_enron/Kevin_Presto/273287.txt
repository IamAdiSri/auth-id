We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch
Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can t miss candidate
The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).This guy is quality and I want to make an offer
Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP
