Please complete Hayden s form for your respective regions
Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form
In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L
The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can t liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can t even liquidate at the bid (offer).Thanks
