If we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems, then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a AA entity........ end of story

If we don t, the market will percieve that negotiating "one-off" terms for trading docs is acceptable
I disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint
