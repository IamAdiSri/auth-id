I hear you on the liquidity Rogers
With Rob making those markets effective next Monday (he is on vacation), we will find out if term liquidity is possible.Please trust me on this issue
You will see a significant difference within weeks, not months
At a minimum, you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders (they may be $3 wide in New York, but that is better than no market).Keep pushing on this issue
With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks, I m sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas.As far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY, I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana
The pool is blowing up as we speak
