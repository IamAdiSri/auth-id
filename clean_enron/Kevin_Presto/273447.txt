I lost $2 million in new deal P&L putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up
With respect to your question, I think the answer is yes because I can sell 02 on-line by controlling the stack (limit orders) and the coal group will sell 03-04 at $35/ton
I now own this at $32 because they mis-mark their curve in 04 by $4.00/ton (ie negative $2 million in new deal P&L
)The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on
