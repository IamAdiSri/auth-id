I am interested in firm LD fixed price energy delivered at the Gannon bus-bar
I have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market
TECO has an entire system they can lean on.I would consider bringing the gas, but you would have to involve Scott Neal s desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated
With respect to volume, I would not want any more than 100 MW.My strong preference is fixed price energy - no toll
Volatility is getting smashed and it doesn t make sense to pay for vol in a spread option
We are a much better bid for 5x16 or 7x24 energy
