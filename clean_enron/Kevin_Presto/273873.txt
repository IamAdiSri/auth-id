Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people
In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay
Obviously, that will not work anymore
I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics
I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from the new owner
If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.You are not off base with Steffes at all
