I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling
It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region
Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.Maps and graphs are very useful
The presentation should be very macro in scope.I would work with Gasill s group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar
