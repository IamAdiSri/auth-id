Thanks
Any assignment would have to be confidential
I don t view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer
If there is a positive NPV trade, we should do it
"Assignment" maybe the wrong word
Maybe we can transfer the ERCOT switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer
