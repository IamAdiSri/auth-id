Because we have lost several people to retail risk management (Rogers Herndon, Narsima Misra, Jim Homco, etc.)
and John Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.Therefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.Sorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes
