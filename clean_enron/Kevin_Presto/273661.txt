I talked with John today and he wanted me to remind you about the e-mail you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to EES
If you recall, we decided on a 2-3 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all P&L risks associated with the site profile/DSM positions.Do you remember this?
If so, John and I did not receive the e-mail
