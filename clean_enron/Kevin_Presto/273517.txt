Can you please add Rogers to the interview list
I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk
Given that Jay Lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under Dave & Janet, we very much need a solid sr. person to run this group
I understand the West is trying to get one of Jay s people to come to Portland
Is Dale a candidate to run both groups?If Jay leaves, we are big time short
