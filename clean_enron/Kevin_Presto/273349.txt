Fletch and I are dividing up Rogers postions (Fletch taking Peak, I m taking Off-Peak)
To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing Rogers to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA
(Rogers has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).In addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where Fletch is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down)
The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift
All of Rogers postions will stay in Wholesale.All parties come out with a fair solution
