Obviously, we will not deliver (or receive if we are long) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis
Therefore, FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow
Cory,Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections
Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from the net position report as well
We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday
