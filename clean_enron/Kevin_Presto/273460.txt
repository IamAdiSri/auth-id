I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets
NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh
I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don t see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.Thanks
