I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT
David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc
QSE contracts, etc.)
