I would like ASAP (by new building) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations (nodes in LMP) and LSE s territory color coded.This will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions
It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions
