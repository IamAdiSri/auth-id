No development is easy
I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome
Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment
We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations
We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result.Last year Com-Ed and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months
The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses.Please work with Terri and Ed
If you need any additional info after working through a plan with Terri and Ed, please let me know
