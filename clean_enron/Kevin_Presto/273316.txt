I m not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail
As always, all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger
As a rule of thumb, prices are good for about 15 minutes.Therefore, let s be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days
For example, summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh
Summer 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days.Thanks
