Don t worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year
It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron
You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come
