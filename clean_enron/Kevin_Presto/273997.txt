Filing looks good
My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached
If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that
I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach
Other thoughts?
I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday
I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #
