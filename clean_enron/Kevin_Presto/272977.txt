The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott Healy s involvement in East Power initiatives:Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on this project.Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and Scott Healy getting personal performance credit
If Ben elects to continue to use Scott s services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between Ben, Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon.Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott s continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton restructuring project
If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing agreement will be made between Jeff, Calger, and myself
The value allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week
If a fair value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition responsibility to another member of his origination team.Chris - Do you agree with the above description?
