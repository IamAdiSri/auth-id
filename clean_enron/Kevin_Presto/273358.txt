For 01 and 02, congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh
Current EES curves are light in this area.For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $ s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).Much like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and Rogers and Don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.I hope this helps
