We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible)
Rather than an obligation (like FTR s), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised)
I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003
Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit)
Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions
This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show
