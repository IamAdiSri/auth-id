I generally agree with your approach
We may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid (because of margin in contract vs. current market), particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it
Potential candidates are Green Mountain, New Power Co, TXU, etc.Any thoughts?
