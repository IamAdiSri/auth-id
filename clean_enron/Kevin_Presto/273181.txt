I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well
I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following: 1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required) 2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx
3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time) 3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm
4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday 5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)Let me know if this works for you guys
