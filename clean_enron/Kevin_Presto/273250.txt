I don t agree with either 7 or 8
The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive
Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance.My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and, if utilized, transitional only for a 1-2 year period
The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs
