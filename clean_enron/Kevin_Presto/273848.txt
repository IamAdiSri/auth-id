I believe Wabash has also terminated
Don,As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time
Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred
I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues
