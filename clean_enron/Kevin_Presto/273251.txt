Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed s gas and coal plants approx
2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004.The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found
I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback
