A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24
We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico
That s the good news
Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $ s, of course)
On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx
6:00 pm.Are you guys in?
We will have a blast
