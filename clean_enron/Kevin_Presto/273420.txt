We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor
I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.)
on the 5th floor.If you do this, then there will not be room for the retail gas group, which means you need to work with Tammy Shephard and Wes Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas
