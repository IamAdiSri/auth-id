I am interested in lakefront property on Lake Travis which is within 3 hour drive of Houston
Given the technology sector meltdown, I am looking to "bottom fish" for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value.Please feel free to e-mail me with "value" opportunities that come up
I did not find your CD-ROM user friendly and I prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements
I am looking to spend 200-250k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 275-325k range.thanks
