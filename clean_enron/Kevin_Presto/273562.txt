I am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes
It is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/Mwh price liquidations
The tables on the top need to have dates and summary info.Please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly.thanks
