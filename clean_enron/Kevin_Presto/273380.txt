Yes, you are correct
Todd is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.With respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes
The only one with any significance is the counterparty name
I expect Mitchell-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement
Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.Talk to you soon
