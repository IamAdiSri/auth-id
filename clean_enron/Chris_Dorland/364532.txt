I hope school is going well
I am sure you have heard but things are getting back to normal around here
I think working for UBS is going to be really good
Seems like the cultures are going to mix really well
I am thinking about buying a porsche
I really like the 993 s but I don t really like the 996 s. Looking around for a nice low km 1994-97 C4
Anyway don t work too hard and keep in touch.Chris
