X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTGrigs,I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons
Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays
Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d)
In Chris s opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in
Hope this helps
