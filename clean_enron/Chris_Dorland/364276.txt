X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTWayne,I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland
I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back
Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn t an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.ThanxChris Dorland3-1663
