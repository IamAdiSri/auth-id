What questions?
I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don t remember any questions
I hadn t seen the jokes before but they were pretty funny
The sports ones were pretty good
The others were pretty tasteless, so they were my favorites
I feel much better today
I m already getting psyched up for the weekend
I am going to play golf and not drink
I hate alcohol
I am on the wagon
For good this time
At least for a week anyway.Chris
