I m done!I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading
I have to set up the economics page but that shouldn t take long.What about reversals from our currency book?
Which way do the reversals from the other books go?The cash deals aren t all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical position doesn t balance but I will talk to Mike about that.I can see a light at the end of the tunnel
Hopefully this makes things easier on you.Thanx for all your hard work!Chris
