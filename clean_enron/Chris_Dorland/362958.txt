TashaHow are you doing?
Did you have a good stampede?
I had a great stampede but got a nasty cold
Work is going good
Do you know Ryan Flemming?
He went to Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine
Anyway, he is getting married August 12 so I ve been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for his wedding
Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents
Did you know my brother moved to Toronto?
I need to find a smaller place but for now I m staying in Kensington
That is all that is new in my life
We should hit a patio and have a drink one night
Take it easy,Chris
