X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTI am going to be moving back to Calgary from Houston in mid september and am looking to buy a loft or condo in the downtown area
I am thinking about 17th ave. and Kensington but I am open to other ideas
I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few months and would be interested in getting together to look at properties
If you could send me an e-mail with your contact info
I will call you to arrange an appointment
Thanx for the time.Chris DorlandEnron North America1400 Smith StreetHouston, Texas 77002(713) 853-1663Chris.Dorland@enron.com
