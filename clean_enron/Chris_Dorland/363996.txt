X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTI think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work
If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North)
I ll let you know
If I m not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back
Let me know...Chris
