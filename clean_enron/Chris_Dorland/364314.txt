X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTVickiI called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May
I never received the check and am wondering what to do next?
The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago
I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have
Please contact me if you need any further info
or with any questions
