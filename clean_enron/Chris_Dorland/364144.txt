X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTJill, Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy
What is with people (that article) ?
Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours
I am pushing for a 4 day work week
Why Calgary?
Why not?
I love Calgary
Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career
This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole
I think it is a promotion
Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world
This city has few redeeming features
What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty
Actually, it isn t that bad
Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary
In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can
Kerrie got engaged
Good for her
I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention
I am not engaged
I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela
No big loss
Too old for me anyway (31)
Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY
I am going to have to visit some time
I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination
Or is NY home for a while?
No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen s wedding this weekend
Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary
Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday
My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring
Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.My family is doing great
My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff
Dancing and buying shit for their house
Both of their health is great
My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.How is Meg doing?
Is she in Australia now?
I should get in touch with her
I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night
Good for her
I hope all goes well for her
