X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTHiSorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges
Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi
Hope you are feeling better now
Saturday was fun
I shouldn t have gone to the bar
Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home
He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up
I imagine he picked up some lonely girl
I would love to do lunch one day next week
Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi
