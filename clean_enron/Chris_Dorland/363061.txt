Kim,I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight
Do you know the name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation services?
She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name
I am wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers
In regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info
that Margaret needs with the exception of University transcripts
I had to order those and probably won t get them untill early next week.Thank you for all your help!Chris
