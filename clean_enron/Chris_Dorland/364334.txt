X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTStephane,Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone
I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting
Let me know if you have any questions
ThanxChris
