Lloyd,I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM load forecast model works
I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to day sensitivity analysis
I haven t met Kevin yet so if you could mention this to him I would appreciate it
I would also like to sit down with you some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our analytical efforts
I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some goals as to what needs to be done
Let me know if one afternoon this week works for you
Thanx,Chris Dorland
