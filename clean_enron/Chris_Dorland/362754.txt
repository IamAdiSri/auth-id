Andrew,Nice to hear from you
Hope all is well in the UK
The millenium came and went and I think I had a good time
I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML
Good for him
That is a shit business with no future
The broker is the buggy whip of the financial services industry
I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to visit
I have to run but I ll keep in touch.Take care,Chris
