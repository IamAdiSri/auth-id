We are going to have a meeting to discuss S/D in Alberta and the west Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs
The focus of the meeting will be to fine tune our very rough summer forecast for the "X" (NWP Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin).Everyone is welcome
Free hotdogs and donuts for the first 100 customers!
Bring the kids, we ve got fun for the whole family.Chris
