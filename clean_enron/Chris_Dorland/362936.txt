How are things going?
Learning lots?
Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today
I m not doing anything today but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that should be good for a headache
Friday I m going to the Chick Wagon party and Saturday to Nashville North with the boys
Weather has been good and looks like that will continue
Did you find a gym yet?w/bChris
