It s great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months
You ll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede
Things here are pretty much unchanged
Working quite a bit and doing a little snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends
Things could definately be worse
Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks
That should be fun
Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing nothing
This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and I need a break
Met a really cool girl recently
Will advise if anything interesting devolops there
It s a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no idea why I am at work
I think I m going to go to the driving range
Take it easy and w/b!CD
