X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTHi Traci,I hope you are having a good week
I am still a little tired from the weekend
Went out with my brother and a bunch of friends friday and saturday
Superbowl on sunday
Made for a very long monday
I have cooking class #2 tonight (soups and stocks)
Should be a good time
Starting to get a little busier at work
Hopefully we will be up and trading sometime next week
I am coming to Red Deer this weekend
If you aren t busy we should do something on Saturday night
Have a great week and I will talk to you soon
Chris
