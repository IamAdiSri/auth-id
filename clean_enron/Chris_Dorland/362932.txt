When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning beds
Your sunglasses are fine
I wore them while I was hangin around the house last night
My neighbors think I am a total freak
Maybe it wasn t the sunglasses but the "Sweatin to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all night
I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius
I am so bored
I m going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good
Better get back to doing NOTHING!cd
