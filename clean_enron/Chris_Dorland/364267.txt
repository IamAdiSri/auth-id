X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTIan, When I said spread I didn t mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points
i.e
if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65
Sorry if I wasn t clear
Call me with any ?s
