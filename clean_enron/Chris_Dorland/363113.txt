FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary
I have actually thought about the problems a little bit
Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663)
Things in Houston are good
The weather is great now
Year round golf is nice
Power is a total shit show
The volatility is crazy and this is the off season
I need to get rested up for the summer
Take it easyCD
