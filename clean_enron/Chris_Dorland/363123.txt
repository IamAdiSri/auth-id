Patrick,Good to hear from you
I won t be needing my blubber where I am
I moved to Houston at the end of September
Things here are good
I m trading electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well
I never did make it to Toronto this summer
Hope things are going well for you and keep in touch
Chris
