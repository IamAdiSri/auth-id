X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTCrystalSorry it took so long to get back to you
My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs
Lots of fun
I m glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation
Are you over your cold yet?
It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July
I didn t do anything exciting of the 4th
I watched the NY fireworks on TV
We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest
