I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a vehicle from a dealer)
The following were the values it came up with for a Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND)Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND)The retail number seems way too high
I think something like $23 000 to $25000 would be fair.Let me know what you think.Chris
