I never get any good jokes which is why I haven t been sharing any
I am having a shitting week
Sick and tired
I can t wait for the weekend
I am going to sleep and golf
Where are you going on vacation?
There aren t many weekends left in the summer and that sucks!
Out of the weekends that are left I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto
I am never going to play any golf.gotta hop
