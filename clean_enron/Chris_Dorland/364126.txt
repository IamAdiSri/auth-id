X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTMikey,I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo
I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area
I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst
A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods
Have you heard of it?
What is the plan for the weekend
You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl s with the Dorlands
Maybe we could track down Johnny after
Are you taking a chica to the wedding?
I am so looking forward to coming home
I got my face ripped off last week
Talk to you later...Chris
