The wedding was great!
Too much fun
Once again I m hung over on a monday
No great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle
I tripped on a cord to a video camera
Mildly embarrassing
My friend was a rock
I think I was more nervous than him
Ft. Mac is a total shit hole
On my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft. MacMurray, once."
No Houston for me
Thank god
I have to go to a party at my boss s on Saturday
I think I might try to play golf as well
I will be taking it very easy
No more booze
My liver hurts
Chris
