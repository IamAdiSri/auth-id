Jill,All is well in Houston
Finally getting settled in
Work is crazy
Trading power is not for the faint of heart
This is susposed to be the quiet season and I can t believe the volatility
How are things with you?
All is well I trust
I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat
Better go but keep in touch!Chris5151 Edloe #14306 Houston, Texas77005H 713-588-5131W 713-853-1663C 713-416-6694
