X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTI really want to live in Altadore
I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang
I don t know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ?
Close to downtown
I am thinking infill / townhouse
My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore
I am thinking of checking those out
I am looking for minimal maintenance
Do you have any ideas?
