X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTDave,I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning
I don t really feel that it is Stephane s responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer
If you would like we could look at doing an MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.Chris
