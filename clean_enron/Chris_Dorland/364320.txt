X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTStalker,I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke s aquisition of Westcoast
I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke s marketing organization
Let me know when you have got a minute.Chris
