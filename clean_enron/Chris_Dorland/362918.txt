Can you come and see me when you get in
We need to do more to tie out the risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long or short
My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile
We need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie out
If that doesn t exist we should talk systems about creating it
Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.Thanx,Chris
