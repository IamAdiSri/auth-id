Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today
The fucking nasdaq is down 10 % today and the dow was down almost 5% at one point
The TSE was down 770 to 8880 at one point
I think that a lot of margin positions got squeezed out of teck length
I say buy the solid stocks CSCO, LU , MSFT, ENE all look great.Chris
