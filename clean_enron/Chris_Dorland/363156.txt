Kim,Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan
I haven t received anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up
I would like begin contributing as soon as possible
Thanx,Chris(PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is this correct?)
