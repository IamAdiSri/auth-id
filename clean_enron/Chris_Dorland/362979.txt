I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my buddy s wedding this weekend so I can t go golfing
That sucks
It is so nice outside
Maybe I ll work up the energy to go for a run later
Probably not
I am such a lazy piece of shit lately
I am definately going to go running now
Self depreciation has motivated me
I need to buy some rollerblades
Where did you get yours?
Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively inexpensive
Any thoughts?
Maybe I ll look for rollerblades when I m out this afternoon
You should be proud of me
I was able to stay out of the bottle all weekend
Quite an accomplishment don t you think
One hour to go
Someone shoot me!
Chris
