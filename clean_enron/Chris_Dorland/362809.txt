Scott,I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals from Mar.28th.Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.9452 done by MikeEOL ID # s132116132569and 1 done by meEOL ID #132967The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it.We added the deal back to our model
Let me know if there are any problems.Chris
