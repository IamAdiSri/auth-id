Margaret,Just wondering how my Visa was coming along?
I had a confusing conversation with Jeanne in relocation services this morning
The way I understand the moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same time or after I leave the country
She seemed to think that I had to go to the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada
Can you shed some light on this?Thanx,Chris Dorland
