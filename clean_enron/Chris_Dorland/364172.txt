X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTDawn,I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today
I wasn t sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent
The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement (3.4) and termination before end of term (2.1)
If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter
Let me know what you want me to do.ThanxChris713-853-1663
