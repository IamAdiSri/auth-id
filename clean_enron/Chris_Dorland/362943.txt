How s it going?
Hear you are working pretty crazy hours
Went to NN with the boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good weekend
I have a post stampede cold so I won t be doing much other than work and sleep for a few days
Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.Chris
