X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTRyan,Sorry I haven t gotten back to you
As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts
Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi
Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me
The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end
As far a snowboarding I m not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas
I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend
Hope all is good with you and I ll talk to you soon
Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend?
