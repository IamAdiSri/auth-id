I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun
Was the weather good?
Houston was hot
Very hot
I better get used to it though because I m moving there
That is why I have been so crazy lately
I am going down there to trade power in the North East
Pretty crazy shit
I gotta hop but I ll write more later.Chris
