Anne,I still haven t received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston
Can I get copies of those somehow?
Could you send my something in the inter-company mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed?
I haven t received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird
Thanx Chris Dorland(P.S
thanx for the PRC info.)
