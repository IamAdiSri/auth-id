X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTBrad,I need to top up my RRSP for 2001
My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881
I have contributed about $5500 through Enron and Enron has contributed $3200 to my pension plan
Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000
The part I wasn t sure about was the pension contributions
Let me know and I will send you a check.ChrisPS I am going to Vancouver next weekend to look at buying a sweet Porsche
