I was not hung over yesterday
I had 3 beers and went home
How about that for self control?
I watched women s gymnastics olympic trials on saturday night and did some laundry
What a loser I am
I am going to Sylvan this weekend
My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her going away party
Meg s cabin parties are generally epic gong shows
I need to rest up this week
I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday
Now if I get some rollerblades I ll have the official pants
I don t think you need to take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week
Can t you do it yourself?
I could probably even do it and I m the most mechanically inept person in the world.Chris
