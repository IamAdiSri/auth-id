X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTSherry, This stuff looks perfect
I think I like the 385-B the best
I don t think I want the hutch though
So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533)
Can please order the pieces you don t have in stock
Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff
Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House
Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company
