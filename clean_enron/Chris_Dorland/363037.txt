Nav,How are you doing?
What are you doing?
I am still working for Enron
I have been trading nat gas for about 3 years
I am moving to Houston at the end of the month
In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US
Should be interesting
Crazy volatility
I will probably have a heart attack at 26 but that s life
Hope things are going well for you.w/b Chris Dorland
