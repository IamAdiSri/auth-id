Saturday was really fun
Golf was great
Mike and Andrew s group was by far the drunkest foursome
Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to play pool
That is when things got out of hand
We got Ryan a bright yellow T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters
Call me tonight and I ll give you all the gory details
My head still hurts
