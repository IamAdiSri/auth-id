X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTKimI briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit A (US salary but in CND dollars) which is incorrect
As I will be in Calgary in Monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to Dawn
ThanxChris
