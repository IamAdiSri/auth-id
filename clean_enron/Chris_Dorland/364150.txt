X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTKim,I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go
In particular I was wondering what happens to my Enron savings plan (401k) when I go back
Let me know if there is anything you need me to do for you.Chris
