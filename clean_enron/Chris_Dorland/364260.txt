X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTKim, I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule
I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends
If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday
Let me know when you would like to get together
I am sitting at 3208b
Thanx Chris
