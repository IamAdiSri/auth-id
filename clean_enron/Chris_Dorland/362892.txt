I am sorry I was short with you on the phone
The gas market is a total shit show and our economics are out by $1M
I worked until midnight last night and I am very tired
We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some steaks on Saturday after golf
Danny and I can leave after dinner or first thing in the morning on Sunday
I hope your (and my) work week improves
See you tommorow!Chris
