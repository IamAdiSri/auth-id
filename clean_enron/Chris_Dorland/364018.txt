X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTRod,What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks?
Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap
I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive
Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter
