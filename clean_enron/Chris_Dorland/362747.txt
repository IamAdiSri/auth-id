Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst
I had about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer between Friday and this morning.Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all I know
Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing happen to him last week.Chris
