Mike,How are things going?
I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily
Things have been relatively quiet lately
Doing a little snowboarding and watching lots of movies
Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 days a week
So far I m at one in a row
Things are looking good for a repeat today.Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office
For all your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum now.I think Lambie helped them out there.Take care,Chris
