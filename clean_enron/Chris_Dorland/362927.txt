I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday
It is the Enron customer party that day
As for Nashville North I don t know if we are going there or somewhere else after
I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school nights
I likely won t be going out again until Friday or Saturday
Am I going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around town?
I hope not
Chicks dig me in those glasses
