X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTWhat s up?
I nearly drowned on the way home the other day
Beautiful weather we re having
Are you feeling better?
I got a cold but I feel better today
The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night
Tonight is the MTV movie awards
I really need to get a life
I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene
I ll let you know if they are coming tommorow
