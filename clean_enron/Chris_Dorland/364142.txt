X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTGlad to hear all is well
I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses
It isn t about finding the meaning of life at work
It is all about the $$$
Work hard
Make $$$
Retire young
Things with me are great
Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go
Take care
