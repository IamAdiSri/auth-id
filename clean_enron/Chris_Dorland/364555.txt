X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTJohn,Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend
Car I was going to look at sold already
How are things going?
Married?
I am soo glad to be back in Calgary
I didn t think much of Houston
Life has been pretty boring
Looks like things are going to get busy again
Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy
A new sub of UBS AG
Should be good
Seems like at great company
AA+ credit will be nice
They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing
Hopefully a little more stable than Enron
I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be
Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.Take careChrisChris Dorland401, 3511 14A St. SWCalgary, ABT2T 3Y1h 403-214-0454w 403-974-6910c 403-875-6146
