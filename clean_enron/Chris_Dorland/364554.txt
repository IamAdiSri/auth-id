X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTHi Traci,I had a very relaxing weekend
Slept 10 hours both nights
Worked out and chilled
Very good weekend except for the weather
No worries about Friday
The highways were ridiculous
My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week
It will be good to see him
I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th
Maybe we can get together then
