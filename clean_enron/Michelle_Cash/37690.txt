I think this looks good
For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones
That makes it easier to populate
One other field to add would be visa status
As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process
You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column
Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary
Thanks
