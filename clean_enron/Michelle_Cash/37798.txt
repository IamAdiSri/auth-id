I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.I agree with Lizzette s view of the persons who don t sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit
If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term
