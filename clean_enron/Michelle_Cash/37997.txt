Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser s attorney
He basically wants a year s pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible)
I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand
Let me know if you want to know the details
I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.Michelle
