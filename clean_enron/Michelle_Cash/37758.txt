This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?
I don t want there to be any other surprises, so I d like to include "known and unknown" type language here
Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?
Let s be very clear
I d also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys
