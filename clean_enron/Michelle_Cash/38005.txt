FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company
It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful
The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims
The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards
I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves
I would like to talk about how to manage that
Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I ll set something up
Thanks
