Bret,I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran Mayes of ENA HR will conduct
Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent modeling of benefit costs
We would like to have our outside counsel in Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian or Quebec law
I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide whatever other assistance may be needed.Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for employment/labor matters
I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our outside counsel designee
