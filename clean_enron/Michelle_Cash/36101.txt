Debi,Your plan sounds good to me
You all have done a good job of researching this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them
What is the harm in accepting them?
Are we obligated to interview the candidate?
Given this situation, it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially since their "proven track record" is only for one placement
It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes
Let me know if my assumption is not correct.Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary
It certainly is well-intentioned, but I wouldn t want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing
So, unless you feel compelled,
