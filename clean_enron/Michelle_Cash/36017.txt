Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this
I have a vague recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information
She was involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?
Then, we can discuss a strategy
Thanks
Michelle
