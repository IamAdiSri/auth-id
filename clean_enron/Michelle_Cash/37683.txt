Here is a proposed communication regarding severance plan changes
This proposal makes me most nervous
My recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan, thus letting the plan speak for itself
We then could arm HR with a list of FAQs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole
What do you think?Also, Kriste, we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication, as not all Enron entities have this plan (e.g., NEPCO)
Same thing with vacation
