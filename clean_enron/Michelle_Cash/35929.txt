Thanks for the draft.Delaware is the proper state.I thought the deferral information was sent to you already
There is no "plan" document per se
Instead, there is a description of the program
I will re-send that to you today if you don t already have it.Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference call on the other question
My morning today is wild; tomorrow probably is better
