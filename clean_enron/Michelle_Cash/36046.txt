Davie -- Meets many, but may have some developmen needs works just fine
I just don t want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets requirements when, in fact, there are developmental needs that are obvious when compared to persons in strong.So, I am happy with your proposal (although I suggest that your second proposal does not meet the "fairly up" goal).Cheers
