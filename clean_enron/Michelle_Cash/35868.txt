I agree with Brian
I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, this morning)
So, we probably should start with that group to see if there are any gaps in the email system
I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor
