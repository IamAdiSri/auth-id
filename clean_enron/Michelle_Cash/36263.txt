Elspeth, do we want to do a new agreement, or simply assume the obligations in the old one?
If the former, I d do a new agreement
If the latter, I believe I simply can do an assignment agreement, once I receive a copy of the current agreement
It also depends on the language in the old one, and whether we believe it protects ENA
So, we d have to look at it.Sharon, do you have the file on this person?
If so, let me know, and I will have someone come and pick it up
