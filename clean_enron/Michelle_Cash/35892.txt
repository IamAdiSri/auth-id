Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language
I have another one for you
The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may be facing outsourcing
There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the transition
Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated
Thanks
