Leslie, I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn t get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest
Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop
Would it be possible for us to arrive late?
