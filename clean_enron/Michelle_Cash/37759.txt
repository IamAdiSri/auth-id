David,I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days
I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc
They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only
For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing
It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice
