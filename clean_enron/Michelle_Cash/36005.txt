My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline deal
In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the Bridgeline entity
It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the employees are sent there via an assignment letter
(Pat, you may recall that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have given you the transaction name at the time)
So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron employees
I am not aware of any change to that structure
Fran, do you know of any changes?
Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to the Bridgeline entity?
