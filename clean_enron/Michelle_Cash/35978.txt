Cindy, Tim, Marly, Pam, and Neil -- I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this weekend
How about 6:30 am on Saturday?
After that, you can schedule it at your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks
I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don t worry, I only have 5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey s shirts to be ironed
That shouldn t take too long.See you then
