Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation
I would like to clarify one thing: at this point, I don t know for sure if we are having law students work with us during the summer
Why don t you check with me in April or May to see whether we are hiring summer associates
If so, you are welcome to go through the interview process
Thanks
