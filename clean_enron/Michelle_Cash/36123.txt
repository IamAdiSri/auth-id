Kristina, Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA voluntarily (although I don t really know why we limit it to voluntary terminations -- I have to look into that)
I also will send you by messenger the draft letter to a company (which I don t have on the system) and the letter I sent to the individual we discussed.I hope these help
