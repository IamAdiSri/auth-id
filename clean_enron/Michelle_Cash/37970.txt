Hi, Janel,I thought that I initialed those already
If I didn t, I ll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp
If I didn t initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.I ll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group
She can either assist you or find someone else who can.Thanks.Michelle---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michelle CashEnron North America Corp.1400 Smith Street, EB 3823Houston, Texas 77002(713) 853-6401michelle.cash@enron.comThis message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges
