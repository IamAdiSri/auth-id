I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP incentive plan
She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the plan
Jeanne, could you please circulate one?I ll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this process should not wait for me
Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we should be ready to finalize it.Michelle Cash
