Kerry, What are your thoughts on this issue?MichelleMichelle,We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you
The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift
Please review the following scenario.For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift
M T W Th F SREG 8 8 8 8 8 OT 8 SHIFT N N D D D D Interpretation 1The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:REG $400SHIFT 16OT 124.80 ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)Interpretation 2Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows:REG $400SHIFT 16OT 120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them?Thanks for your help,Diane
