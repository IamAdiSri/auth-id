Eric,As mentioned in my voice mail, Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP employment matters
I believe that he may be better suited to answer your questions (and may have the time while I am out on vacation next week)
His number is 973-966-8117
I have left him a voice mail telling him that you may give him a call, so he will be prepared.I hope that is helpful.Michelle
