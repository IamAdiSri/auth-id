I haven t specifically referenced NuTech in my questions to them
I also probably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of interest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron
We ll discuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions
Yikes!
