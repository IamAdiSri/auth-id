Dorie,I think this looks good
I have two tweaks:On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I d delete the "let me be clear" introduction
I think the last sentence speaks for itself
In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don t pay, "we will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the reference to attorneys.Let me know if you have any questions
