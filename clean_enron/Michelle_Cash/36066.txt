CPage: Would you please forward this directly to Pat?Pat, For your information, Chris Tomko has resigned from GSP
GSP has hired a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR person
I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling in the next few weeks as this transition occurs
If you are available on Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt
Would you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know your availability so that she can set up a conference call?
