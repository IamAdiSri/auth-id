Matt, Thanks for your email
I believe that there is an agreement in place between ENA and Enron Expat Services
In general, the contract is between ENA and the employee, if the person is an expat
The assignment letter covers the employee s transfer to Expat Services
We haven t usually amended/assigned the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc
are through ENA
If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, and I am happy to handle it.If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.I hope this answers your questions
I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years
If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions.Thanks a lot.Michelle---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michelle CashEnron North America Corp.1400 Smith Street, EB 3823Houston, Texas 77002(713) 853-6401michelle.cash@enron.comThis message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges
