Mike,I have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims
I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.I will send you a new waiver form to use
The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA.Michelle
