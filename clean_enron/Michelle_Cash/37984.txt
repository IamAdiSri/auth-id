Gina/David, I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions
My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation
Presumably, if they have a Click at Home PC, they can do it from there
If not, we should be able to facilitate it manually
