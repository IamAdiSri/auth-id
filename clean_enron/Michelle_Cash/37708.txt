Hi Dawn,I am working on a project that requires the review of employment contracts
I do not have signed copies of several Enron Canada agreements
Would you mind faxing them down to me via Twanda as soon as possible on Friday?
We are on a Lavo deadline
Thanks.The people are: Chad Clark, Mike Cowan, Paul Devries, Eric LeDain, Chris Dorland, John McKay, and John Zufferli (only if he signed the one we did for Enron Canada for him-- I have the ENA one dated 12/24/99).I appreciate your assistance
Please call Twanda before the fax arrives, as it is a central legal department fax and not a private one.Thanks a lot!
!Michelle
