I spoke with lara robinson this morning
She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made
She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released
Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees
Seems unusual to me
Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience
My number is 713-218-7155
Thanks
