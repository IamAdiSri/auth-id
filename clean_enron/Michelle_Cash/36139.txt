Thanks for the description
Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went onto Amazon.com to look at it
It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would enjoy
FYI: the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys
As a matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to DC in August!
But, we can wait til Christmas, so go ahead with your plans.Congrats on the furniture
I am sure that you will be happy with it and will love the new look
See ya
