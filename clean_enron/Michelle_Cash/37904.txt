I will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all Enron entities domestically
Similarly, some Enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, etc
So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications
I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue
