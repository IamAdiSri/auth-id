Andrea,I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our sessions
It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of that meeting
I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business
It looks like our action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I ll ask for an extension because of my travel)
In the meantime, you can meet with David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans without me
(I am not sure how helpful I am in any event)
What do you think?
MichellePS, do we need to include Don in our group?
