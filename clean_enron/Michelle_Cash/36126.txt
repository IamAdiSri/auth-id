Pat,I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement for Greg Whalley
I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation of value for options/restricted stock
For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my assistant send it under separate email cover.Thanks a lot.Michelle
