Drew,Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who has had some issues
I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement
I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning?
713-218-7355 is the fax number
If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I will prepare on this topic
I am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and Louise for comment and dart-throwing
I can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 713-302-5522.Thanks, Drew.Michelle
