Sarah,At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue
Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements
Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first
Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective
Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement
