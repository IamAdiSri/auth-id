Happy to talk with you about the ADA -- I ve actually written two papers on the topic and edited an article in The Houston Lawyer on your very topic (albeit several years ago, which was before the Supremes spoke on the issue)
On the Senior Specialist position, I am happy to discuss that with you as well
Please get with my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 39402 to schedule a time next week to talk
