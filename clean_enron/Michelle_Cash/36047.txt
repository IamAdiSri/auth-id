Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate
"Met" expectations probably does not fit the average person s view of a person in Satisfactory
Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would be more accurate.Where are we on the total revamp?
Has that been postponed until next year?Thanks
