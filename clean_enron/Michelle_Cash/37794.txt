Thanks for the thoughts
We are getting through it.Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman s hat
So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman
I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!
!Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun
I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn t into that type of thing
We went to the opera Sat
night -- Tanenhouser
Wagner really is uptight, isn t he?
Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music
I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center
It was amazing
Joan Lunden MC d. The Houston Symphony provided music
Video from George W. Bush
Speech by GHW Bush
Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!
), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony
It was quite the event
Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother (one of these things is not like the other!)
Still, we had a great time
