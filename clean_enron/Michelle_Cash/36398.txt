Thanks for the info
I just need simple, basic frames
No decorations or anything
That way, they can go anywhere, and aren t specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc
So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best
I could use 5x7" the most.Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine
Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it
I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.We are looking forward to your visit
Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th
Do you and Marianne want to go?
I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested
