Pat,Thanks for your comments on the agreement
As an FYI, the stock awards already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to address that situation.I appreciate your other thoughts
Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an example as suggested by Pat?Thanks.Michelle
