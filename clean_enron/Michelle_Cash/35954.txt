Hoyt,If GSP LLC would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it risk bringing them back for light duty work?
Why not wait until they are fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers comp scheme?Also, Hoyt, you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc d someone from Media General in the prior email
