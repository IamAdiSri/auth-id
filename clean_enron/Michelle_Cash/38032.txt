Frank,I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week
During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday
I haven t seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today
Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn t heard of that if you were.Would you please let me know the status?Thanks a lot!Michelle
