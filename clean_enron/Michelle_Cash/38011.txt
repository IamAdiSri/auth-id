Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco
Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status
Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months
Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity
The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco
