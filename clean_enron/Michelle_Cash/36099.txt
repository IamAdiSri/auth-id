Privileged and ConfidentialThis email contains legal adviceHoyt and Melissa,I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for MG/RW
It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don t want to hire
I am not really familiar with the specific facts here.The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc
decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees
So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor
Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced
It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don t want to hire them all, which is the other alternative)
Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers.I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion
So, let s try to discuss it
