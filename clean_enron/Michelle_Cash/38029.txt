Dear Grandmother,So sorry we didn t make it yesterday
We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind
Oops!!!
He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn t hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok
So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.Hope all is well with you
