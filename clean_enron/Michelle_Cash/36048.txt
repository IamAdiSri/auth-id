Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on Williams
I hope that happened
I would like to have a petition ready early next week
It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.I believe Ajello will be finalized this week
I sent our signed version to Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon
Once that happens, we can dismiss.Thanks
