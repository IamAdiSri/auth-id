Andrea, You are right
I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who was setting up the meeting
I apologize for the oversight -- it was not intentional
I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings
I am sorry about this one
Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a compensation system or a feedback system?
Because the process tries to address both, there is a tension between the organization s interests (comp, promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)
This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system
This tension has given people lots of heartburn
To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn t create too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees
The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating
For example, a "strong" performer really could be excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third category
For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic
Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old "HR" language
For example, a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like: "Always raises the bar; franchise player," etc
rather than a "HR" definition relating to demonstrating criteria
Also, people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn t much difference between the two.There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive
Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process.This was only the first meeting
