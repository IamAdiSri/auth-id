David,I believe the agreement was signed
It would have been a Corporate Services Agreement
I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on this
I have cc d this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version.Thanks
