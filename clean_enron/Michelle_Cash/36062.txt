Chuck,Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?
Given the correspondence I ve been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled
Otherwise, even if we do "agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays
I am ready to hear what this guy has to say about my client.Let me know your thoughts
Thanks.Michelle
