Attached is the resume of Dominic Carolan, who currently is working at Global E&P
He is looking to move elsewhere within Enron, given that the assets in Global E&P are going to be sold.I understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience
He might be a good candidate
I met him today, and he is pleasant and professional.If you are interested in interviewing him, let me know, and I will get it scheduled.Thanks
