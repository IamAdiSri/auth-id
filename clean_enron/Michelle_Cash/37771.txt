John and Louise ,I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus
I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks
A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp
I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues
Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.Let me know if you would like any more information
You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.Michelle
