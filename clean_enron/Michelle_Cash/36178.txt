Jennifer,Thanks for the email
Cameron is great
He loves his new school, even though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was
Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and bulldozers and ..... )
We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few weeks ago
He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver s seat and "drive."
They also handed out plastic fireman s hats
