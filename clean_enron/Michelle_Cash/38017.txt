Diane, I ve left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please follow up, as he either didn t get my message or has not returned my call
Basically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we want to dissolve it
Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail?
Thanks
