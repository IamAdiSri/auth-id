Lance,Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have
Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected
Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months
PRC results would not be the sole factor
Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review
