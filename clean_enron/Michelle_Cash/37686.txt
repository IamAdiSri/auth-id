Kriste,I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete
The only one in question is for Brian Redmond, whose contract we did not have
Jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda
Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing
Then (I hope) we ll be done!!!
