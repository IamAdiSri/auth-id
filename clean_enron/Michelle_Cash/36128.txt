Pat, here is additional information about the transaction we have been working on
Of course, they are going to finalize tomorrow
I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation
Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk?
My thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i
claim if it is received
Alternatively, we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party
