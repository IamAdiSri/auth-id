Lorraine, When you get back in the office, let s talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub
I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub
We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.Thanks, Kim
