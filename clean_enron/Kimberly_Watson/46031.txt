Dear Gaylen and Jodi,Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San Juan area
The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000
This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%
Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range
Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments
Thanks, Kim
P.S
I m having trouble attaching the drawing
I will send it under separate cover
