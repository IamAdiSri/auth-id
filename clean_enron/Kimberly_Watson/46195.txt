Randy,Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning
We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station
Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them
We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings
How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?Thanks, Kim
