Kirk,Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday
I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project
Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe
I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don t hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.Thanks for keeping me posted,Kim
