Gaylen and Jodi,Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet
Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending
I ve got a draft that I will update for the spending
I ll send it to you soon
By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?
I am scheduled for the second session.Thanks, Kim
