Hey Tiny,Thanks for your voice mail regarding Griffith
I will scout it out on Monday and let you know if I hear any confirmation of the water supply
Gee, I hope it s not true
We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing
I believe that HR will be sending out the invite
I thought it would go out this past week, but I m sure you ll see something early next week
We will start at 8:00am on the 8th and go until about 7:00 or 8:00pm
We will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston.Thanks, Kim
