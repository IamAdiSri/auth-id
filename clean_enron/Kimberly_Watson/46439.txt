Bill,I ve made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method
Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement
The letter looks great to me
Thanks for all of your help on this
Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.Thanks, Kim
