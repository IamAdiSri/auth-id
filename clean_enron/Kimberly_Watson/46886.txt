Kay,Thanks for the update
Actually, I did not realize that Jeff s computer had Prophet X on it
I would like to get together with you in the next few days and discuss the software package with you
We may indeed wish to keep a user on it but I would like to understand it better
I m out of the office tomorrow, but will be back in on Thursday.Thanks, Kim
