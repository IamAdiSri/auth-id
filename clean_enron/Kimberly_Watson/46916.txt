By the way, I don t think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today
Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July
Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month
TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR s. The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.Thanks, Kim
