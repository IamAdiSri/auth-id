Steve,FYI, I just talked with Jo and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term
She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us
She (and probably Vernon) will get back to us
I ll keep you posted on our conversations
