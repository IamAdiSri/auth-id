Mark, thanks for the notice of this meeting
I m glad you will be attending
FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from Nanci MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I m not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization
Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations
I m not sure we ve ever been clear on this
Please continue to talk about Red Rock with these folks
What would Aquila like to see TW offer?
What are their thoughts about the West markets?
What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe?
FYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning
I will be in EB4179
I need to meet with Martha and pack up this office
I should be in by 9:00
If your schedule permits, perhaps you and I could meet for a few minutes on Agave before your 10:00 Aquila meeting?I ll call you when I get in
Thanks, Kim
