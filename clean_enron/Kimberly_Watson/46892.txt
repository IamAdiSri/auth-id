Jean, all is correct except that Steve Harris should get two flat screens instead of Michelle and me getting a third panel
However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for Michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL
Is there an extra one around for her?
