Hey guys and girls,Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip
I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights
I received an immediate response from the Hotel Condotti
They have 3 standard rooms available
I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I m guessing from the prices they charge)
From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled
They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo
The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215)
It s $25 more than the Sheraton but we won t have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap
They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I ll confirm this cancellation with our reservation
I think we should go with this
I m not sure how fast I ll hear from the others, if at all. Please let me know your thoughts ASAP
Thanks, Kim
