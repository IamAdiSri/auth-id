FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase
He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe
If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.Kim
