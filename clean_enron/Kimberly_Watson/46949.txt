Richard,These summaries are great!
Our desk is starting to get more of a commercial focus on these imbalances
May I ask you to put a date on the actual spreadsheet?
As I keep them from week to week, I find that I can t always tell which one is the most current summary
Many thanks and see you in the next Tues. meeting,Kim
