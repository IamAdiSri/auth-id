Gary,I just wanted to get back with you on the Salt Dome Storage question you asked earlier
I have not been able to find anyone in TW who has knowledge of exploring it, but per Kevin s recent message, it looks like SWG is beginning to pursue it
Do you have any comments or thoughts?
I will be in Omaha on Thursday of this week for a RM meeting, maybe we can hook up for a few minutes and visit about this.Thanks, Kim
