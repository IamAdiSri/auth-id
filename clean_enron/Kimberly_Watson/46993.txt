Bill, To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet)
Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows
She is completely independent from the hotel and I m sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has
They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket
It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see
I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now
You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead
Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best
Don t forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
Keep us posted
