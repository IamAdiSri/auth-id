Tiny,I wanted you to know that I am putting a "check in the mail" to you (and made out to you) in the amount of $50 to be used toward the gift for Rich
The money is from: TK Lohman - $20 Mark McConnell - $10 Kim Watson - $20I apologize I didn t get it in the mail earlier this week, but everyday seemed to be a Monday for me this week
If you have Rich s home address, I would love to send him a note.Thanks for coordinating this!Kim
