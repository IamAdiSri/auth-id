Oh, My Italian Amigos,I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.htmlhttp://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htmPlease check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think
The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice
We know that Firenze was fine and I m certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game
John, do you have a preference?
Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is
Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome
Once I tally the votes, I ll confirm the hotel.Thanks, Kim.P.S
Paul, you ll have to give me your credit card information
Call me with this info, do not send email
(Due to Big E issues, I cannot delete any email messages and I don t want this info hanging around.)
