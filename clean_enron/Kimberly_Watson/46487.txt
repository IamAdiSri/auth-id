Danny has provided us with some tickets to the 2002 Olympic Winter Games Reception celebrating the Olympic Torch Relay in Houston today
We have VIP Seating and tickets to the VIP Area (although I m not sure what this means)
If you (and your spouse) would like to attend a private reception tonight at 6:30pm at the Renaissance Houston Hotel - 6 Greenway Plaza East (Edloe @ Hwy 59) please let me know
John and I will be there and we have tickets for two more interested folks
Also, the Olympic Torch is being run in front of my home, The Spires, tonight between 5:00 and 5:30pm
You all are welcome to come over and see this event
I will try to leave the office around 4:15 to head home
Please let me know if you would like to come, I will give you directions.Thanks, Kim
