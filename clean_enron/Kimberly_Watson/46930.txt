Greg and Maria, FYI
Here is a report for the July Capacity Releases on TW
PG&E, Sempra and Texaco all released on an Index to Index spread and are above max rate
Elizabeth has the history of TW Capacity Releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates
Thanks, Kim
