Hi Kirk,I got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office
My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning
Next week looks wide open
Would you mind waiting until next week?
I just want to make sure we are not holding you up
Let me know your preference
By the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?
