Katie,When I talked to Kyle last week I didn t realize that you are still driving into downtown everyday
I have my trunk loaded with some contributions for MANNA and would like to pass them off to you when it is convenient
What is your schedule during this week?
I could meet you during lunch or at the end of your day any day this week, whatever you prefer.Many thanks,KimP.S
