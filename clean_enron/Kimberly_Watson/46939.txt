Good Morning Kirk,I hope you had a nice weekend
I have been working on the Interconnect Agreement for the Big Sandy Project and I would like to schedule some time for a telephone conference with you as I have a few "blanks" in the Interconnect Agreement that I would like to discuss with you so that our draft is as complete as it can be
Would you have some time on Tuesday AM or Wednesday AM?
I would also be available on Thursday 2:00-3:00pm
I m thinking we need about a half an hour
Also, I can update you on the remaining capacity on our Red Rock Expansion which could be used to serve the plant.Thanks, Kim.713-853-3098
