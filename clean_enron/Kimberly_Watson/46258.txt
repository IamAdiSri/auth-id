Earl,We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar s property)
As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW
Our in-service date is May 1
If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know
Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.Thanks, Kim
