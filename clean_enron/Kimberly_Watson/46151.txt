Hattie, This recipe is from my Paris cooking class
It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm)
Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway
Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth
She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients
It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking
Good Luck!
