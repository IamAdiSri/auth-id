Please review the attached agreement for the Big Sandy Interconnect
It is very standard
It is reimbursable
It has a few blanks that have to be filled in for certain dates that we (or Caithness) don t know just at this time with respect to receiving regulatory approval, in-service date, etc
Caithness wants this agreement for their prospective equity partners to review for content
Teb, Lee and Ron, this agreement has not changed since you have last seen it, but I just wanted you to give it one more look.I would like to email to Kirk (Caithness) tomorrow afternoon
Thanks, Kim
