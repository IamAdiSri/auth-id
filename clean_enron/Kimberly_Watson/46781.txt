Hey guys,We got our first response to a Florence Hotel
Please read this message and take a look at the attached links to their hotel website to get a feel for the location
Janell and I think that it is close enough to the city center, but we are open to fresh eyes
Let me know your thoughts
I sent about 12 faxes this morning, this is the first to respond
Janell has personally called about 8 hotels in Florence and they have all been fully booked
Let me know what you think
