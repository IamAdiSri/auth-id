Steve,FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001
However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo s RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year
Martha and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months
Thanks, Kim
