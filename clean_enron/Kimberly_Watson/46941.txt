Sasha,Great, sorry, I didn t see the scroll bar
Thanks!If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza s, that would be great
I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections
I would order plenty for our hearty crowd, someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning!Also, will the Mad Potter provide the wine, beer and soft drinks?
Is there anything else that you can think of?
Thanks, Kim
