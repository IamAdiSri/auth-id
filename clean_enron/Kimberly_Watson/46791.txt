J, D, P and J,Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info
I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples
I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive
She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car)
FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked
Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel
I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow
Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming
She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us
I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts
She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars
We can put everyone s luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.I will keep you posted as we hear more
Thanks, Kim
