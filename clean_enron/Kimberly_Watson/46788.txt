MSN shows you not logged in
BTW, my car is ready
I will pick it up tonight
It was the starter
$550 (includes a new battery).FYI, ILY, K. PS
I will keep you posted on the ferry poll
I still vote for arriving in Lucca earlier in the day, only because if we don t arrive untill evening, then we will spend the whole next day in Lucca instead of getting to Florence
I m trying to keep us (you and me) whole for 2 - 2.5 shopping days in Florence before heading to Rome
