Hi Kyle!I must not have your current office telephone number
Please send it to me
I would like to connect up with you this weekend if you are available
I cleaned all of our closets last week and have the "big load" that I would like to pass on to you for your MANNA collection
How on earth are you?
I am still sad and overwhelmed from the Sept. 11 tragedy
I cannot believe we watched that event unfold like that!
These are certainly interesting times....Call me or email me, I d like to visist!
Many thanks,Kim
