Rick,Thanks so much for the lead!
In fact the timing is very good since we are trying to determine a viable scope of the Sun Devil expansion.Lorraine, would you please give Rick Padia a call and see if there is a fit for us to service his area
Maybe they can form a coalition of all the land owners for the White Cliffs Area?
Also, please keep Rick Smith posted of our conversations with this possible new customer(s).Thanks, Kim
