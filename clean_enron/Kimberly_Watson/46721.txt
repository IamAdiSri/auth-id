Susan,I just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in Eric s group (plus Steve Dowd) have a place to land when we move
I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack
Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?
Thanks, Kim
