My Italian Amigos,I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano
They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights
They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD)
The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath
I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located
This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!)
They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it
Is this hotel still OK?
I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available
Please let me know what your preference is
I can clarify in my next fax
If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full
I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.Please advise.Thanks, Kim.P.S
We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!
