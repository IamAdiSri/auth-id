Lorraine and Paul,Please coordinate with each other and provide Steve an update by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) as to where your conversations stand with your customers on flipping these deals from Index to fixed rates
He has a meeting with Stan at 2:00pm and will be asked about these I m sure
Also, Paul, would you please provide Steve any additional thoughts ( like we discussed yesterday) with respect to how and what things are included in our VaR
Many thanks, Kim
