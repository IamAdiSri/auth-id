Dan,Thank you for the great card
I hope all is well with you
What are you doing now?
Are you still commuting to California?
Are you working for someone in Houston?
ENE is up today to $0.63
Gosh, it still feels like we ve got the decimal point in the wrong place with our stock
Just heartbreaking
Oh well, I m glad 2002 is here
This will be a better year for all!Keep in touch!
