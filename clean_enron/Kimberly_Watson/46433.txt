J, I don t have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept
I don t worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith
I ll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe
I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02
If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8
If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I m more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome
Have a great day!
