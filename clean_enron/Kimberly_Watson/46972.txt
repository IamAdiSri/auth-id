Mary,You are going to have such a great time!
Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves
You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings
A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine
Is your jacket water wary?
Tennis shoes are definitely OK!You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh
Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town
Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town)
Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start
Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!Call me when you get back
I d love to hear all about your trip!Hugs back at you, Kim.P.S
Stay away from Haggus(spelling?
