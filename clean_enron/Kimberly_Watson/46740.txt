Jean, can you help me?
My cell phone was stolen from my briefcase sometime this afternoon
I also received this message that the recipient below in not known....I do not know who this person is or what/why is was returned to me, so now I am worried that someone was at my computer doing something before the screensaver came on
Can you help me do some detective work here?Thanks, Kim
