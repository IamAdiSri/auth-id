TK,John and I had such a big time at your house Saturday evening!
It was so kind of you to open your incredibly spectacular home to us
I just love everything that you have done....it is truly lovely
It was so nice to meet your sisters
I can imagine that your family reunions are just a hoot!
And the food.....well it was awesome.Thanks again
Hope you are feeling better.Kim and John
