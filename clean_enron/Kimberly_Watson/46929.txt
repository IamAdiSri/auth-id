Ramona,Gosh, something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems
Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her
We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools
If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change, but it is too early to make a decision just yet
I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process
I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are, but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year
I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow
Thanks, Kim
