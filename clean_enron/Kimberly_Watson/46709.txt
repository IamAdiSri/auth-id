Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA s to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready
We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop
FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray
Thanks, Kim
