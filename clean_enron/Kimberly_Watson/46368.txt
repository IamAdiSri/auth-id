Steve, Early this week I asked Jo for a rate and the size of volume (looking for the max volume) we could have for transportation on NNG from WT to PH(NNG/TW Gray)
I ve got a couple of follow-up calls into her, but she has not gotten back to me yet
I hope to have a response from her before we meet with Mike Stage on Tuesday
I ll keep you posted.Kim
