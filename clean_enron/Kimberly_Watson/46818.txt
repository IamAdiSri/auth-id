Steve, Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned outage next week for two days
We will talk with their commercial folks on Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop
We anticipate that we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead with their September business as usual
We will also talk with the other SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down the lateral while Burlington is down
Thanks, Kim
