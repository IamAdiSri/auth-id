I ve been caught up in several heavy projects and forgot to put it all together
I have all my info in a big envelope and I will get it sorted in an organized fashion and get it to you in the next few days
If this is a problem, please let me know
I would be happy to discuss this with you
Again, I apologize for the delay.Many thanks, Kim
