Mark, I reviewed my files and did not find the Dandby section
I don t believe that I looked in the asset book
Check with Jim Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn t in the file) - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff
