Jeff,I am looking for the person who paid for my wine last Friday evening
Lorraine says it was not her, so I m suspecting that it was you
Needless to say, I left without paying and what is worse, I didn t even think of it until I got home that night after dinner with John
Where you the kind and unknowing one that floated my loan?Also, I ve been thinking about Paris and London
Would a week night or weekend night be better for you/Lisa and John/I to get together for a brain, map and book transfer session
If you have a date that works for you guys over the next few weeks, throw it out and we ll get something on the calendar
Thanks, Kim.P.S
What is Lisa s email address?
I d like to send her a note
