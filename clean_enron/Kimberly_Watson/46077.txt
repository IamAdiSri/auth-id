Paula, I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits
I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days
If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine
It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate
Let me know when you would like to rally.Thanks, Kim.P.S
Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!
I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!
