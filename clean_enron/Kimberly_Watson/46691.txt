Although we expect to receive specific feedback on our July 6, 2001 proposal to Pemex for the TransPecos Pipeline very soon, we sent the attached letter today to Pemex (with a copy to Kinder Morgan) that will withdraw our proposal on October 1, 2001 if the LOI has not been executed
Kinder Morgan has agreed with the sending of this letter
Pemex has been aware of the contents of this letter since Monday, September 17.We will keep you posted of our detailed discussions with Pemex as they proceed.Thanks, Kim
