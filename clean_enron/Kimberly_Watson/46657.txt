Hey gang,I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto)
I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning
Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled
I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation
Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.Let s start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip
If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June?
Any thoughts?
Thanks, Kim
