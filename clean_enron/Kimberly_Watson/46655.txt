I don t see you on MSN, but I am on the phone now with Nanci and she is having back problems (a long story, I ll share later), but we are going to have to cancel the lake this weekend
I have a 10:00 meeting, so I will have to run soon
I ll call you when I get back.I m still OK taking off tomorrow and next week
Maybe we stay home this weekend to be with Herschel, and if he is better, then we can take him to my mom s on Mon or Tue and go on to the Hyatt Hill Country next week.Thoughts?ILY, K
