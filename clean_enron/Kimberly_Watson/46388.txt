TK can sell Feb-Dec to Sid Rich for $2.27
Or sell remaining Jan, Feb and March for $2.01
We can sell 10,000 for Feb/March
We can look at only selling 5,000 for rest of year, leaving 5,000 to catch upside(or downside)
We need to at least sell Feb/March before 1:00pm AGA report today
Are you OK with this?
