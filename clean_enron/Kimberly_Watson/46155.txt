Martha, I m sorry you had to miss lunch today
Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS)
Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains
He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call
His office number is 713 739-6715 (if 739 doesn t work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy)
His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct)
Please give him a call
He is very happy in his new role
My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him
Give me a shout when you get back into the office
Thanks, Kim P.S
We moved up to 39 last weekend
I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41
Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk
