The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border
Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate
They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal
I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan
We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex
I will make myself available at your convenience on Monday morning to discuss.Have a great weekend
Kim
