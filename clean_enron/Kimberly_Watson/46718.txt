Hi Pam and Donna,I am not certain that Susan has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (Eric Gadd s group) with respect to the move
In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with Susan as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in
Susan will also coordinate Steve Dowd with the rest of Eric s group in the move so we need to keep a space for him
Susan,Please let me know when you have accounted for everyone in Eric s group (plus Steve Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment
The goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops
:>)Thanks to all for your help!Kim
