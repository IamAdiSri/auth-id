FYI....I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area
I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss
I ve got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas
I hope to get him to send in a request this week
Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow
The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11
Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations?
