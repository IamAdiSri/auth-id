It is that time of year
Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November
Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14
Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002
As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting
Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right
I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items
:>)Thanks,Kim
