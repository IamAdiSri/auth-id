Dave,May I ask you to take a look at this spreadsheet, please?
Steve and I are hoping to connect up with Danny tomorrow afternoon and discuss both our fuel strategy and our Index to Index Deal strategy
I have put together some numbers on the I to I deals, but I would like to discuss them with you to make sure I am not missing anything

You are also welcome to join our meeting if you are available
