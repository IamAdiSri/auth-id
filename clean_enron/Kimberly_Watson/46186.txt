We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability
The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including
They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon
I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano
I ll keep you posted
I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision
If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?
I have not checked into other Rome hotels
Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.Please advise.Thanks, Kim
