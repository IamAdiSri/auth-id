Earl,Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?
Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?
FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week
If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files
Let me know if I need to talk to Agave
Thanks, Kim
