Tiny, I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month
I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29
Will you be attending?
Let us know, we d like to meet with you if you are going to be in town
Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich s gift?
When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet
I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.Good luck on Bisti!Thanks, Kim
