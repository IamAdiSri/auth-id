Hi Dan!I am glad that your family is well
My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC
I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.I will be glad to bring the tape in
I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk
We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor
I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too
Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses
I will bring it as well
Thanks and take care
