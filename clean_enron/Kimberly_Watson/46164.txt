Hattie, Yes, I will fax it to you when I get home tonight
In fact, when you get it, why don t you call me and we can talk about it
This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school
They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks
I hope I m not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe
My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098
Thanks, Kim
