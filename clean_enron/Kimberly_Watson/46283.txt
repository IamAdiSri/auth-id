Steve,Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed
I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25
Do you want to see the real-time feeds?
It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users
Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP
