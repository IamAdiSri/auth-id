Mansoor, Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar
We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1
The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week
I will let you know when it is officially signed
If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like
