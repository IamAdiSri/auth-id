Ron, John would like to know what our HP is at these units and what type of units are they?
What is the age of the equipment?
Is this something we would be willing to share?
I told him that our run time on these units was less than 1,000 hours
If we are OK sharing this info, would you either call him or email this to him
If we don t want to share, just let me know and I would be happy to call him and let him know
