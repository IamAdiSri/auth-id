Hi Jeff, John and I are also good to go for tonight
We are open on flavors of food
Some things that come to mind off the top of my head are: Raven Grill, Goode Company (Mexican or BBQ).....I m trying to think of some place that we could have drinks, beer or wine....we are completely open
Any thoughts on some place close to your neighborhood?
John and I were planning on meeting at the house to join up
I ll bring the maps/books etc
Does 6:00pm sound OK?
