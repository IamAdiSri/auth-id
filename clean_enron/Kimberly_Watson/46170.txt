Earl and Mansoor,I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect
Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also
Please confirm that you have what you need
I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed
Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect
Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago
I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay
Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?
Does anyone else need to see it?
Please advise.Thanks, Kim
