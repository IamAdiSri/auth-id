Hi Sherri, Well, your ears must have been burning
I have been thinking about you this week
Gee, a lot has happened since we last spoke
I m still here
We are very busy on Transwestern
I would love to catch up with you, are you available by phone sometime next week?
My calendar looks pretty open next Tues, Wed or Fri
I look forward to visiting with you soon
Kim P.S
Martha is still here, also
She is with the Northern Natural side, I m with Transwestern
