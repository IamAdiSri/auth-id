Michael:The September ISDA meeting is coming up and I am starting to plan my schedule
I will be in London on Monday and Tuesday, Sept 12 and 13
I will also be in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday
Are you free for dinner on either Monday or Tuesday?
Who is the best person in Frankfurt to give me an overview of the trading markets in Germany?
Regards,Mark
