Larry:On the resume, only one comment
I would split out Community Affiliations or just delete it
I will give the resume to a friend of my in HR and ask where he thinks the best fit would be in Enron
Do you want me to e-mail your resume to a few people I know in other businesses?
If yes, please send again without the note to me
Mark
