John:I will get on your calender in January when I am over
It is also my understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that Chinese walls are not necessary
But it will be necesary to address if equity trading starts up
Also, there are probably related issues, like restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading
Hope you have time to enjoy the Holidays
Take care
