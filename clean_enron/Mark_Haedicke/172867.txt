Here are my thoughts so far:1
Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron Rothwarg2
Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week3
Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months4
Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA5
Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval6
Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot be hedged
