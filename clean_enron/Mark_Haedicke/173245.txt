The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years
I think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients
Within the next month, I have asked Janette to schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new organizational chart
I would envision that we would focus on the following: review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issuesreview of the top ten legal risksform contracts and other documentation projectslegal budgetlegal resources, inside and outsideperformance metricsIn addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC
Let me know what you think about that.Mark Haedicke
