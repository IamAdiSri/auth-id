I have a few thoughts on the offsite
I think we could have a theme of restructuring and change
We would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future
The presentations could include the following:1
What we learned in CA -- Sager2
Preparing for workouts -- Mellencamp3
Lessons learned in international -- Lundstrom4
Deregulation of energy markets -- Kean/Shapiro5
Managing Legal Risks -- Haedicke6
Executives -- Frevert and Whalley7
Europe presentation8
Retail presentation
