I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about joining ISDA
He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron
He is familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining
I told him he would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive Committee
I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000
Please give him a call at 011-551-1-2322100
I think he could help build membership in ISDA in Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America
He goes by Emilio
I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina
Let me know if you have any questions.Regards,Mark
