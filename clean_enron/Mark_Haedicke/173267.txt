I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let s make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited
My thoughts are as follows:1
We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.2
It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed.3
There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.4
Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.5
Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.Please give me your comments.Mark
