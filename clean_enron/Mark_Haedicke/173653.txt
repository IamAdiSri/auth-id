Mark:I will be in Amsterdam for the ISDA board meeting on March 15 and 16
I would like to get an update on the APX before leaving for Amsterdam
For example, do we think it will be successful?
What kind of volume is trading?
Also, I wanted to get your recommendation on what law firms or maybe the APX that I should visit while I am there
Hope things are going well.Regards,Mark Haedicke
