Dad:The name I have is Dr. Vinberg
He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 80s
I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good
He recommended that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if it is productive
His number is 713-622-1441
He charges $150 per hour and I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston
Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you
If he is, I will propose dates and we can see if they work for everyone
Love, Mark
