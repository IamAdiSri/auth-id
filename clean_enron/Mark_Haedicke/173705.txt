MIchael:I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26
With the launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit business
I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and particular issues in the European market
My preference on timing is in the morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th
Please give your thoughts on this
Take care.Mark
