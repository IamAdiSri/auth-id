George, I think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at hand
I think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have proposed
I would ask Robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your points and then let s all briefly review it
I want to stay mindful that litigation is possible and we have to chose our words carefully in event of litigation
Mark
