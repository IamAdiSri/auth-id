There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso
The idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business
Specifically, Enron might propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs
We would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?Should legal counsel be in attendance?Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?
