Alison:I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading
This is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!
I will copy Paul and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members
Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.Mark
