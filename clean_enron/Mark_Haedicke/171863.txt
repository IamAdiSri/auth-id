Liz:Greg is scheduled to speak on Friday, October 12 at 8:30 am for 30-45 minutes
No slides are necessary
The lawyers will be interested in where Greg sees the growth in the company and where the business is strong
There will be Q&A and I think he will get some good questions
Some possible questions: What does Greg expect from the legal department?
How will the attacks impact on our business?
What will be his focus in his new job?
It should be a very friendly crowd -- since Greg knows most of the lawyers and they know him.I miss you too!
