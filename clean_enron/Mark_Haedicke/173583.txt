Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about energy
I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like financial commodity swaps
Also, I pointed out that innovation has been slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure
I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill
