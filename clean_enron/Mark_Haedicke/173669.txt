I will be in Tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in Japan for Enron
I would like to book time on your respective schedules to meet on Wednesday afternoon
I have some flexibility in my schedule if that does not work for you
I will be in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday too
Look foward to hearing from you.Mark Haedicke
