Kristin:Kevin is very concerned with this charge
Why is litigation now being billed up front?
Why is there a 50% increase in corporate legal?
Why is there a 100% increase in corporate secretary?
Why are we billed for the library when we use primarily electronic sources?
Could you please work on the answers to these questions and get back to me.Mark
