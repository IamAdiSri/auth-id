Jim:Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo:Global Trading -- All lawyers providing legal services for trading activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one group reporting to Mark Haedicke.Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books"
To that end, Mark will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company
The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks day to day
It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report will be prepared for Enron
