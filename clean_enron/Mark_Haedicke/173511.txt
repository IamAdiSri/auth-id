Rick:As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation on electronic signatures
There is a big need to standardize the approach with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations
I think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly make money through a protocol
Let me know what you think.Mark
