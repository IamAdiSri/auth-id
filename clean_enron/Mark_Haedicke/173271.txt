Dave:Based on our discussions this morning:1
Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares
The time allocation matrix will be revised during the year if material changes in the work occur.2
Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000
Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated
A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?]
laying out the procedure to all employees
3
Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel
[Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.]
Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.4
Reopener!
-- need to review where business changes significantly
