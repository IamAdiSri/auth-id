I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades
I propose the following:1
Retention Period -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 months2
Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only the deal terms at the end of a callThe first change could be made immediately and the second change would require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal terms
Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.Mark Haedicke
