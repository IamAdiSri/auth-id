Mary: This is complicated for oil companies
Mobil Exxon only does hedging
Shell has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit
BP Amoco is sort of in between
It is very clear with respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary
The companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application
