The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES request to stay an injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS
The stay allows EES to return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC receivables
In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the District Court for discovery and eventually trial
