Dave:I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups
We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW
We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation
Are you in agreement?
