Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside FERC
It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential
We want the data to be as good as possible
If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations
Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US
