Seth:There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of the office
You should find out that person s name and try to meet with that person in Japan as soon as you can
I think Enron should try to steer one of the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way
I am not sure what committtee that would be at this point
I think you should have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the board level
Let s keep comparing notes.Regards,Mark
