Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:1. our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends2
credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost to customers3
customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products4
customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offeringsPlease give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.Mark Haedicke
