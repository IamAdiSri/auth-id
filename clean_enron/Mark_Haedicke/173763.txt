Terry:Greetings
I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in Japan starting next year
I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?
Would you or someone else you know want to talk about that?
Let me know
Hope things are going well.Take care.Mark
