Bob:I think Enron is more likely to use the intranet service
I was unclear however, if additional service was available in the internet service, such as links to the explanatory books?
I think generally we would want the convenience of having the ISDA materials inside for use by any Enron employee
If the cost gets too high, I don t think members will pay for it
$10,000 sounds ok to me.Regards,Mark
