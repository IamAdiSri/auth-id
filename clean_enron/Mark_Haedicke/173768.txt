Jim, I am looking for weather data by region for 98 and 99
I believe that there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support that
This is background info to support the arguments for standardized power contracts, which are nearly agreed to
Let me know what there is and who I should talk to
Thanks for your help
Mark
