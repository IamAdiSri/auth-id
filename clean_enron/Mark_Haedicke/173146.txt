Jane:ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May
We have heard there may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo
Have you heard of the earlier seminar?
We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go forward on the May seminar
Could you look into this and talk to the traders.Thanks for your help.Regards,Mark
