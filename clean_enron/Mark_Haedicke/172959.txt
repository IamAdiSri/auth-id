Louise:Is Enron ready for this?
I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals
It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide
I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed
Let s talk about what are the objectives
Great question!
