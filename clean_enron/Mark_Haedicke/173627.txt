Great conference in Amsterdam
It was the best one yet
I would like to have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next year
I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a) energy derivatives around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy
If we do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our membership dramatically
Let me know what you think.Regards,Mark
