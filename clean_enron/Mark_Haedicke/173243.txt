Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one year
Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to closing
My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power contracts
Thanks for your cooperation in this matter
Please forward this memo on to the lawyers on your team.Mark Haedicke
