Joe:I think there are several positive things to point out
ISDA is opening an office in Japan as of April 13
They have already hired one person and are looking for addtional people
More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing up the resources in Japan
IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market place
That s all I can think of for now.Take care,Mark
