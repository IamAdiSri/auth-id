Dave:This is for routine and "small" matters only
The resolutions are drafted so that the signature authority is narrow and specific
Frequency is only one factor
An example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and certain defined confirms
I will review the authority that has been delegated currently
[Julia and Deb, please pull the existing resolutions with delegation of authority and let s review.]
