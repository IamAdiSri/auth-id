I m OK with trying what the commercial group wants but we d better be aware of the consequences
If we are successful, it may be a little easier to get Kent his authority to buy third party storage from other pipelines
If we are unsuccessful, getting Kent s thing approved will get a bit harder
I think the PNM proposal is pretty specific and has a nice operational basis that may help our chances somewhat
Also, I m forwarding to Shelley to get a read on any FERC policy landmines
Shelley, the summary of Madden s talk to INGAA that you circulated today quoted Madden as saying that FERC will take up the Texas Eastern remand soon
Are we headed in the right direction?
Looks to me like we may give Madden and his people an opportunity to broaden the current policy a bit without fundamentally changing it
Thanks
