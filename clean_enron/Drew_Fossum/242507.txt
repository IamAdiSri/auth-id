I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about something that doesn t cost us money
He has gained a good bit of experience on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric contract negotiation
His take on transmission constraints is consistent with what Kevin and I had suspected: Alb
is a load pocket and the prevailing flow is west to east into Alb
Constraints only affect west to east flows and a generator in Alb
could always move power to four corners by displacement
Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb
If we are not talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to
