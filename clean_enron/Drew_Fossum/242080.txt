Danny, I m resending as I had the same problem Cindy did
I ll give you a call later today after I ve talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page
The plan that makes the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d project through asap, with no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure
We ll simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January as Stan suggested
I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial hurdles
