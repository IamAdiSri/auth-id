Bob, Steve Gilbert was not working on this, but he thought that the numbers in 10ks and annual reports generally get filled in by Elaine Concklin or someone based on ET&S numbers fed up throught the system by Gilbert s group
For now, I m leaving the blanks in this draft blank and explaining to Moran that I have limited our review to the legal and regulatory verbiage
Thanks
