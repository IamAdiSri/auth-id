STEAKS?
We got em--stay at our joint and eat big meat 3 times daily
I ve got the grill set up so I can flip steaks while sitting in the hot tub drinking beer--its sort of like that Yahoo TV commercial where the sad eskimo family radically changes their lifestyle by ordering the grill and hot tub off the web
