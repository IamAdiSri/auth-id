I am OK on selling these packages on EOL
This approval is based on my understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to sale
Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious because I don t believe Law will see anything on these packages again)
I also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year
Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal
I think we can live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term deals on EOL
ONe last thing, it is marketing s decision whether to include in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate
I think our approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a basis run up could make it a very valuable right)
If you have any questions, call me
