I don t see any immediate problem
As long as the advertising didn t interfere with the effectiveness and efficiency of Hot Tap as a tool for satisfying our posting and notice obligations, FERC shouldn t care
The revenue would be nonjurisdictional and would be treated as such in Northern s or TW s next rate case
As to the "type of advertising," I can t think of a legal or regulatory reason we need to be picky, but we may want to exclude certain types of services that seem to rely heavily on internet advertising if you know what I mean
