Absolutely
I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking etc
We ll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary on that project
On the quick 10 million/day that we ve been working on, there s a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost
Steve Harris and I talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or two
We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup if the alternative doesn t pan out
We ll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes
