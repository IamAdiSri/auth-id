Please find out what you can about which issues FERC is interested in on the Gallup rehearing requests
I.e., did they issue the tolling order because of our rehearing arguments on the confidentiality issue or SoCal s on the rate discrimination issues?
Anything you learn would be helpful, but this info is not so important that risks should be taken to get it
Thanks
DF
