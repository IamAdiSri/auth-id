Good point, but I m comfortable we re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points
They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so
None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not
Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates
I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?
