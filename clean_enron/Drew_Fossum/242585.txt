Please see attached notes of the last meeting with PGE on Topock pcb problem
Lou will be coordinating development of a litigation strategy in case PGE cuts our deliveries below 250 mm/d or pursues decon
of the Topock compressor (with the expectation that we will pay for the work under the operating agreement indemnity)
I volunteered your services, and my own, to assist with this work
I believe the next step is for Lou to set up a meeting to discuss
Thanks
