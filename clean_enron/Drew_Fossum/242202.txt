I agree with your concern but I ve gotten comfortable that the pleading does a good job of finessing the issue
Technically, you are right and PNM s service is neither "firm" or "interruptible."
It is my understanding that PNM assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the customer is a core customer or not, et cet
I think that PNM is capable of determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be firm, even though the rate schedule may not say "firm."
Explaining all that complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing
Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is "firm."
I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful detail on how PNM handles its own priority system
If I misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it
