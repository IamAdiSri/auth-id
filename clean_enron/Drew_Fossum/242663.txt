For those of you who didn t have the patience/patriotism to listen to your president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a highlight: Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic development on the reservations
Langley may be onto something
If he/we can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere
I m thinking of tribal lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc
Perhaps Bill should call Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides
Notice that I m not volunteering to make that phone call
