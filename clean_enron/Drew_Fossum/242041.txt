I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on the $200k we think they owe us
Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this
If I understand ECS position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS fault that manual peak monitoring wasn t operational until December
That argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?
At minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied
But we heard nothing
Is that our story?
If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done
