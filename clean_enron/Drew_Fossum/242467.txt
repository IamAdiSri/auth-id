The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I m not sure it is a legal conflict of interest
The Northern cases he is involved in are not really "GISB matters."
There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance issue that involve GISB standards, however
GISB is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself
As long as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with what GISB wants, he s technically OK
I suspect he d argue that his work in the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB s objective of achieving world domination
This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something
For example, I m not really clear on GISB s structure
Can we argue that it is not a real stand alone entity but rather a "front" for a cooperative group of companies that includes Enron?
If so, we might have a real conflict
Thanks
