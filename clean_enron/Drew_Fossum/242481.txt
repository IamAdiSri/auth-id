So Haskell is trying to play good guy with us on Kansas Ad Valorem while he s trashing us at FEEBLE
ENA is not one of the "largest single shippers" on Northern, at least in the market area
They did that big negotiated rate deal with us, however for 300,000Dth, so I expect that is what Haskell is talking about
They may in fact be the single biggest firm customer among the producer/marketer segment
MKM and I ought to whup up on him down in KC next week on this issue
