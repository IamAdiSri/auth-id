Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase (less basis differential) at some other location (i.e., the permian) thus freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian
The SJ 20,000 would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under someone s transport agreement--in other words it wouldn t be incremental to our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations
I don t know if this will work yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna
I m eager to talk to Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario that Susan researched a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe there are problems or solutions yet to be considered
