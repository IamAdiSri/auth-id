Sorry, just got back from Houston and my duties require me to be in the big O for a few days
Enerson and I were just talking about you on Friday--I m forwarding this to him so he can take you out and feed you
Hope all goes well
Give me a ring if you have a few minutes and I ll give you the update on what s going on up here (dial 87-7449 in case you ve forgotten how to dial us from world headquarters)
