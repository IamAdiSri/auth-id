I heard a great report the other day from David Hill that you guys made it through the Oriskany without any interesting pyrotechnics!
What a disappointment that must have been for Karol Lynn and CNG!
Sounds like a pretty boring operation up there, otherwise I might be tempted to drop by and see the show
Also heard that the knuckleheads from Bath got thrown out of court on their antitrust suit
Shit, all you needed to do all along was get rid of me and things started falling into place!!
!Best wishes for continued success--and Siguaw, stay the hell out of trouble!
