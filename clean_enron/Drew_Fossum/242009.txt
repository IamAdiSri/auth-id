I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options conf
and filings that ROFR cap
isn t posted as available until the ROFR is waived
I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that we are pretty much locked into that approach
On the commercial issue Rita mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the appearance of scarcity
On that logic, we should want to keep ROFR capacity off the EBB until the right is waived
