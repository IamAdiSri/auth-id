Great--Texans know the difference between a dog and a bird
Still unclear whether they recognize the distinction between a hen and a hun!!!

Of course, at Pheasant Haven you can shoot both (and probably the dogs too) so the difference doesn t matter
Kevin, I ve been thinking about your original reqeust and may need to exercise the Legal Dept
veto
These customers of yours are the same ones that can t drive a jet ski without paramedics around, right?
And now you want them wandering around Nebraska heavily armed???
What the hell are you thinking?
