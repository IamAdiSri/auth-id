Thinking about bailing out of the big O for a couple of days w/o rugrats or Sandra
Taking Kari out of her native biome is more hassle than its worth these days
Might just blow up for a long weekend and do some fishing and beer drinking
Send me the name of that book on flyfishing in the Hills--I want to see if I can get it on Amazon
