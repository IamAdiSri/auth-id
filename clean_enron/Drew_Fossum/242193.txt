I think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC s questions without deferring any to other people
Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on so far
You don t need to be an expert on all that, but a basic understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more responsive to what they want to ask you about
If you do get stumped, try to defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview
By doing that , you should be able to get them the information they need without having them cross examine a bunch of other people
Inevitably, if you ask enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers
Lee, I d like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at
Please let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach
