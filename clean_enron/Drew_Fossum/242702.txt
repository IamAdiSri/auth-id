Bill, attached is a memo prepared by Susan Scott that does a good job of answering the several questions that you had about the situation at Topock
Note that in Susan s first answer, PG&E has no obligation to Transwestern to accept gas at Topock
They may well have obligations to their own transportation customers or sales customers that have to be satisfied with Topock receipts, but that doesn t give TW any rights against PG&E
I realize these are not comforting answers, but I wanted us all to have a realistic understanding of where we are
I m running this by Lou in case he has a different spin on the history or the agreements
Thanks
