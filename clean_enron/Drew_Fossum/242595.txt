Congratulations!
Sounds like the merchant storage business has had a good couple of weeks with you guys clearing your environmental hurdles and the Tioga guys finally starting construction!
I may have acted rashly in joining the evil empire--should have jumped into the storage business instead!
Tom, are you the point guy for marketing the project?
I d like to hook you up with our Transwestern marketing guys on possible deals to backstop Transwestern s "Park and Ride" service
We are currently authorized by FERC to use PG&E market center service for that purpose, but I suspect firm or interruptible Lodi service would be better suited for what we need
Best wishes for continued success!
