I suspect that the answer lies in Mary Kay Miller s or Julia White s areas, or both
Mary Kay and Julia, who is the best person to go to to find the monthly sales MDQ from 88 through the end of the merchant service?
I suspect that Glen or Bob could point us toward the monthly aggregate purchase data during that same period (Britt--wasn t this was provided in discovery prior to the first trial?)
I think we are still working on the %Mertzon purchases were of the total--Kathy Ringblom please grab me in the morning on this
Thanks all
