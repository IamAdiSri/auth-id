I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis Langley s meeting with DOE in Albuquerque
DOE indicated that their current PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."
Tino s consultant claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of approximately 7 cents/KWh
Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh
This is at the high end of the range we hoped they d be in.Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don t want to rely on PNM for back up power
They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines
The new pipeline will need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure
They have not asked for fuel oil backup
I know this is starting to look like the project that won t go away, but the power price number looks very promising to me
I think its worth scrubbing down the model we ve used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we d be using
If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest?
