Maria, please take a look at this list of "Reference Entities" and the attached memo
I doubt we have any reason to knock out any of the listed entities based on legal controversies, etc., but its worth a check
From the attached memo, it looks like a more likely reason to disqualify an entity would be credit problems or some other commercial issue
I m in a bind today and out the rest of the week so it would be helpful if you could pick this ball up in my absence
Please get back to me and Mike with the results of your analysis
Thanks
