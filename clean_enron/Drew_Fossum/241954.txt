Attached below is my approval of a bunch of capacity packages for sale on EOL
As you can see, I think there is an important issue of contract language that we need to resolve at some point if we are going to get maximum mileage out of EOL
Please let me know what you think we ought to do about this--in my view, if we are going to sell long term capacity on a discounted basis, we ought to keep using the language we have historically used on what happens if our max rates are reduced and what happens if our rate design is modified
As to the old confidentiality paragraph and some of the other stuff, I m not sure it is worth keeping and running the risk of FERC finding that we have overreached (i.e., the paragraph saying a customer can t ever challenge our discount adjustment)
Lets talk
