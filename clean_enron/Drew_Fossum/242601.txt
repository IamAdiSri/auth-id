As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their intent to close the merger
Tim s best intelligence is that a June 1 closing date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later
Also, until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come undone
If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in
Has Courtney got this covered?
I suspect he s been thrashing around so much on locking in the swap that it hasn t been on his radar screen
I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and the merger closing
(the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$) Also, we ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for us if the merger goes south for some reason
I drafted a letter awhile back that could be updated for this purpose
Susan, assuming Steve and company agree, could you follow up on this (I m having Martha email it to you)
The contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1
Thanks
