One additional point
If we aren t going to try to rebut the "funny money" argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded up to dispute their circumstantial case?
Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes
They argue that unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone
The Enron pipes may be a statistical oddity on this
A very small percentage of NN and TW capacity has been held by affiliates
I think the same is true on Border and to a lesser extent on Florida
Amoco and Dynegy can t have it both ways
If they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe s capacity being held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes)
Can we argue this???
