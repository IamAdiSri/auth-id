A team of folks including Dari, Glen Hass, Don Vignaroli, etc have beaten these issues to death--we have a very detailed set of materials summarizing the findings of the group
Bob Burleson should know that, as I think he was at the meeting when we went over this stuff
Viggy, did we get the info from our briefing on the matrix to the no-shows like Steve Harris and John Dushinske (and Bob if he was a no show?)
If not, we ought to send it to them and ask them to call for follow up
