Here s a thought that didn t occur to me when I marked up the mock trial script
Should we have the consultants prominantly feature "IPEC Busters"???
Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on relevance grounds, it might be useful to at least get some juror reactions to it
With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to assume that Jad s theme will be that Northern s whole philosophy was to breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme
Maybe we ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how our response plays
