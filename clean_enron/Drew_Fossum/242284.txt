Give me a call when you get the chance to look at this and I ll update you on the discussion we had yesterday on automating the request for service process
Shelley, Tony and myself got comfortable that with a few changes to the verbiage a customer sees before he clicks on a parcel of capacity, and with a couple of minor limitations on the capacity we sell (i.e., no Subpart B-restricted 311 capacity parcels) Northern will be able to treat a customer s click on a parcel of capacity as submission of a request for service
