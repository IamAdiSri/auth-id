Note new cost limits for building laterals within our existing blanket authorization (i.e., without seeking a specific certificate)
The $$ is probably still not high enough to give us ability to build the whole project, but it may give us some flexibility
Thanks MKM
Also, has any one heard from Tino or Dennis in the last week or so?
I left Tino some voicemails on a question he had left for me, and the name of the Enron windmill guy, but haven t heard back
Do we need to schedule a follow-up meeting with them to talk about turbine availability and regulatory options, etc?
