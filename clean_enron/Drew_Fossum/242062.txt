Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off shippers supply due to force majeure?
1
If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly no
We re shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure
We have the discretion to grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent operators and so long as we don t discriminate
If that gas is out of spec on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff (Sec
44?
47?
I can t remember which but its one of those) then the answer is the same
2
If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons falling out as liquids
I m remembering the catch all section of the Quality paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that effect
That catch all seems to me to include liquids
IF the c6 and heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no force majeure
I read Eric s very scientific email and I think the punch line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?
The thing I can t remember is whether the Quality section has specific max
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons
If so, and if the shippers are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn t work as good

If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel
Generally, an event isn t force majeure if it is purely economic.I ll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call
