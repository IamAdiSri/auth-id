Great!
We ve got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure of the pipeline
Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the market research issue
I think Tim could probably identify the specific electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the general tariff rate for large industrial service
If we are lucky, there might be some info in PNM s last rate case on the discounted electric rates it gives specific large industrials (if any)
Obviously, any info on gas or elec
loads and rates would be useful
Kevin, I told Tim you d give him a call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim started.I got a call this afternoon from Tino
He asked our help on right of way issues with BNSF
Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we could use?
Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid tipping PNM that Enron is involved
Just in general on the confidentiality issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17
We need to be absolutely sure that we don t tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley before then so we don t get them interested in the leglislative fix we are supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger
Tim believes PNM could spike that leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to
That issue is real immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal (even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).Tino had a new fact to work into the economics: DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure gas load at Sandia in addition to elec
load
No number yet on Kirtland gas load
Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace Montoya at PNM before the end of the year
Has anyone else heard that?
Do we know him?
I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week just to report in on our analysis
At minimum, we can probably pass on the name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway
Sorry about the random message but thats how my brain is working today
