Please take a look at Vig s effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern
You ll recall that Steve s chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate customer imbalances, by month
Proving once again that TW is just a little different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW
I agree with Vig s conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing
I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a correlation
Steve s method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities that occur early and late in a month
Please tell me if you agree, marketing folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb opportunites
In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index will be at the end of the month
In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the monthly index will be, is basically free money
Using that logic, I ignored any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month
I eyeballed the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there s a $.70-.90 arb opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than using Steve s mathematical approach
I still didn t see the kind of correlation I d expect
The correlation is directionally positive in only 4 out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn t even make sense in the months that correlate on direction
I give up, and am removing the arb argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft
I ll route that separately
Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis
"Its better to try [to find a correlation] and fail than never to try at all
