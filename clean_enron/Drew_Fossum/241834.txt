Wow--softball questions
Two thoughts: 1, should we be gentler on the "lack of takeaway capacity" issue?
Steve would know how to play this given Socal s position
2, Did McKinsey check with Enron before taking this assignment from Cal?
The lack of conflict of interest rules in the consultant world never ceases to amaze me
That being said, McKinsey is probably the best outfit we could hope for to take this investigation over for Cal
I d like to be on the call to be sure our script for FERC on the neg
rate deals dovetails with what we tell these guys
Let me know when the call will be
We may know what the TW FERC order says before this conversation with McKinsey happens so lets talk again before the call
Thanks
