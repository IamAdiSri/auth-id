Lou, I agree with your legal analysis
Susan confirmed for me that the TW tariff has no specific PCB limit and I think your analysis is accurate on how FERC or the courts would react to the "toxic substances" language that is in there
Please go ahead and get back to Bill and report your conclusions, with my endorsement if that adds any value (perhaps the value of another neck in the noose)
Also, it is worrysome that PG&E has an argument that any dollars they spend on Southwest must be reimbursed by TW under our agreement
They might feel free to pour money on Southwest to keep them happy, even if Southwest doesn t put much pressure on PG&E and as a customer relationship strategy , in the belief that it is Enron money they are playing with
Can we do anything to keep PG&E honest on this?
Given all of the above, is it our strategy to continue to manage this Southwest Gas problem as best we can as part of the broader PG&E problem?
