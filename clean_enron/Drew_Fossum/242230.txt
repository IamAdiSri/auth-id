Some of you may have seen the article in the WSJ already, but for those of us in Omaha (who don t typically get the Texas Edition) it was news to us
Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business
I m not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for financial or commodity deals
