Thanks for the tip last night!
I called and ragged around my thieving ins
company this morning and they are going to cough up some serious insurance for me and Sandra at suuper-cheap pre XXX prices
Cool
My only concern at this point is that my over-insured status may create undesirable incentives for the little ladies in my life (the dreaded "worth more dead than alive syndrome"!)
Adios amigo!
