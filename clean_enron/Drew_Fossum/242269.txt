We are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of files accumulated during the Conoco litigation
Kathy is taking the lead on reviewing our document retention policies and advising Britt and I of what she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep
In some instances, the appropriate approach is not entirely clear
Have you folks run across any "document retention policy specialists" that she ought to talk to?
We have a fairly detailed policy applicable to "Interstate Law" (which I guess means GPG law--the policy document is fairly old) but I m less clear on what authority or right Legal has to enforce the doc
retention policy as to other groups
Rod Hayslett suggested during Conoco that it would be good if Legal followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the policy
His comment arose from a little situation in which we were served with requests for "3 year plans" and Rod was displeased to learn that some folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago
He (and I suspect all of us) would be happier if that didn t happen again
Any thoughts?
Thanks
DF
