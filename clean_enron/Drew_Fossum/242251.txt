I noted in the Finance and Accounting report that you guys are setting up a meeting with AA to talk about the draft risk management document that folks had been working on a year ago
Please include Tony and I
We had some questions and concerns that I have long since forgotten but will renew and talk to you about before the AA meeting
Thanks
DF
