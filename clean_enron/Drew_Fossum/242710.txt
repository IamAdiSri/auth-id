Three things--first, Bill Cordes confirmed that the $200,000 O&M contribution ET&S law already agreed to is the item mentioned in Bill s memo I forwarded to you Friday
In other words, he doesn t expect an incremental contribution from us
Second, Mike--Martha is out sick today so perhaps we can talk to the ladies as a group tomorrow
Please let me know
Finally, the ethics test
I say all 4 of us check out this thing in Belize
I volunteer Eric to give the speech (my espanol not good)
