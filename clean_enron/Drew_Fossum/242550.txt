Hey, it worked great--I replicated several sets of messages without a problem
Then, on Sunday, I did something and now can t get the computer to load up windows
It stalls out on the "Property of ET&S" screen right after I turn it on
Please make it happy again and ship it back up
(I don t know if this would cause such a problem, but I may have shut off the computer off on saturday before I got the message saying "it is now safe to shut off your computer."
) Thanks
DF
