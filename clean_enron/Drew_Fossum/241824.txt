Congratulations Adam, and welcome to ETS to both of you!!
You guys may not have heard this, but Mike Moran is retiring and I m taking over for him as general counsel of the ETS organization
Does this all mean that I m your lawyer again just like in the old Zond days???
Weird
Good luck and best wishes!
