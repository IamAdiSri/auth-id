Cool--my law beanie is getting a little tight lately
Stan communicated to Oneok that we want to keep the dialogue going and that arbitrating the measurement issue is necessary so we can clear it out of the way and allow everyone to focus on bigger issues
I don t know if they bought it, but if we approach them (maybe at the Stan level) with potential business deals it will tend to validate the message Stan sent them
We haven t heard anything since we launched the arbitration on Friday, so I m not sure if they are ballistic or not
Given Stan s message to them (Kathy--pls forward Stan s letter to Jeff) I think he ought to either raise the West Texas line himself or else tee it up by calling his counterparts and letting them know what were up to so there is no confusion
Maybe you or Harris could bring it up at the Mon
meeting or sooner if necessary
Let me know if you want me involved in that conversation
Thanks
