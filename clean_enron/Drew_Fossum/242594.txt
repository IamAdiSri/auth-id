I finally stumbled over something that forced me to get my shit together and update my email addresses on you guys
Its been a strong couple of weeks for the merchant storage business!
First you guys (and FERC) finally put the last nail in CNG and Penn Fuels coffins on Tioga, then old Larry,John and Dill finally dust off Lodi and get going!
Wow!
I shouldn t have joined the evil empire quite so fast!Seriously, congratulations on starting construction up in PA
I ran into my old law partner Hill out in DC last week and got a great update on the recent battles against those drips at CNG and Penn Fuel
Siggy, what are you going to do without Carol Lynn to fight with?????
Best wishes for continued success!
