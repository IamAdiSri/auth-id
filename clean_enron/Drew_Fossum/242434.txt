Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo
I think we need to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis government contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and scrub down the numbers on the power plant
If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that point
You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal
Either we d have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and Steve go directly to the ENA deal guys
