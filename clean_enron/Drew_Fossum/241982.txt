I don t see any serious problems with this
There are a few things you two need to verify or get comfortable with: bullet 6 says PG&E has made all payments in a timely manner
You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I d suggest replacing it with: "Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."
Also, the mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul
We should probably list the rating service by name to avoid ambiguity
There are also a couple of minor things: in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add "the" at the end of line 1
Call if you have questions
