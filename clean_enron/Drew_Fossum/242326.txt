No, we are paying them $3 mm in addition to handing them the Hobbs line and giving them the option on the Eldo-Spraberry line
I haven t really thought about it, but I guess the transfer price for the Hobbs line should be some nominal amount--$10 or something
I ll give you and Louie a call in a bit to discuss
Thanks
