We all knew about this concept--its Danny s "Newco" idea
The only thing that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary s office
I knew about the name a couple weeks ago
As far as I know, no one has signed off on any particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when "Mavrix" starts transacting business
We all better understand at that point that this may be a "lose lose" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes
If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there s no way to plow the losses back into some regulated entity
It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals
