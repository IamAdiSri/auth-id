As we discussed, based on this email and the other information you have given me, I have significant concerns about our ability to use the ENA products discussed below
Having ENA IT people involved on an ongoing basis in maintaining the software and assisting us in using it would probably constitute a violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the appearance of marketing affiliate violations
As I understand the risk books, etc., confidential information on our various capacity positions would be all over the place and difficult or impossible to firewall off from ENA people working on those books
If there is some firewall strategy that the ENA folks have in mind, i.e., if those IT people are or will be employed by Networks or Corp., I am eager to listen, but from what I have learned so far, I am not comfortable with our use of the ENA system
