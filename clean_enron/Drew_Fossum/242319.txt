Whaaasssssuuup
Sack--you need to update me on where the hell you are these days
Flying jets in Denver?
Chicago?
Where?
Reed, you need to check your emails more than once every 6 months
Huet, I ll call you on the apple data tonight or tomorrow
Loon, since I sent you a cool email, you need to invite me to at least one boondoggle on Wednesday (Dougie is going to the Fascist convention in Philadelphia all next week to schmooze)
Carmany, you are just weak--you need a wife and about 7 kids to throttle your lifestyle back a bit
Egg and Kate--I have nothing mean to say to you just now, but I ll work on it
