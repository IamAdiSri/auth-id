Jim--its been a long time since I bothered you!
Congrats (tentatively) on the settlement with the Navajos--sounds to me like you and Mr Soldano did some fine work!
We still haven t pulled the trigger on arbitration of the OneOk imbalance (the measurement issue) but we are getting closer
Before we do, I wanted to get your thoughts on our "two prong" strategy once again
You will recall that we intend to initiate the arbitration and simultaneously file a dec action in Texas state court
That approach is described briefly in the attached pleading
The pleading is pretty brief and terse--both Grant Harvey at Gibbs and Bruns and Britt wanted to keep the dec action as straightforward as possible
I ll ask my secretary to block off an hour sometime this afternoon or early next week if your schedule permits
I look forward to talking with you!
Thanks
