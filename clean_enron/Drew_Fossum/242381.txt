Good point on the timetable
If we can get to the letter of intent stage Caithness soon after this meeting Jeff is setting up--by mid July maybe--what would a realistic timetable be?
It looks from the map like the ROW would be all along existing hiway--not virgin territory
If this thing is a "lateral" not mainline, and if we can keep project cost below the 2001 prior approval blanket cost limit (whatever that is--around $21 million I think) can we build under the blanket???
Lets talk before the meeting in Houston so we can have a complete reaction for the Caithness guys on cost, timetable, etc
