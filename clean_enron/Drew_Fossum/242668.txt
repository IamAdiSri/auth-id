You guys probably don t remember this (I didn t until I checked the file) but there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we left to be attached to the final contracts after execution
My recollection is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die
On my originals, I m missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate Schedule No
21), and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement
Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done with it
Thanks to you all
DF
