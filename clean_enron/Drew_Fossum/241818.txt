I could see accruing $100,000 for legal fees on the ONeOk arbitration--which will be concluded in May
We could also reserve against OneOk s counterclaim--which is about $4 million
We expect a final arbitration decision 15 days after close of the hearing which should be well within the 2d quarter
We may decide to use post-hearing briefs, however, which might push the decision into the third quarter
Let me know if either of these is worth pursuing
