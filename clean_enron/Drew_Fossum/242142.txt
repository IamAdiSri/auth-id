Stuck on the phone so I thought I d email you
Stan has asked Mike Moran if TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti gouging" statutes or common law
You know, the laws that say you can t charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of water during a drought
I think we need to research two things:1. are there any such laws applicable to our business?
(Cal
state law would probably be the best place to start)2. could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?
I.e., if the CPUC whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday
If that happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for transport, or so the logic goes
I d like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan s staff meeting (no written memo necessary)
Based on that prelim
research, we can decide what else need s to be done
Thanks df
