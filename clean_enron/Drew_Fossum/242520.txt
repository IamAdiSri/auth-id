Mike Moran has informed me that the FTC and U.S. DOJ, as part of their review of the El Paso-Coastal merger, have decided to take a close look at the merger s possible impact on competition in the Chicago-Wisconsin market
In this regard, those agencies need to set up a conference call in the next two weeks to discuss that issue with experts on that market from Border and Northern
This will not be an on-the-record deposition
It will be a conf
call and what I expect to be an informal question and answer session on what we know
Representatives of the Wisconsin and Illinois Attorney General s office (or whatever agency it is in those states that deals with antitrust issues) will be on the phone as they are working with the Feds on the merger
I think either one of you guys, with appropriate supervision, would do a fine job
Please let me and Mike know who gets the black bean and what your general availability is and we ll get it set up
Thanks
DF
