To synthesize what I m hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni), our story is that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points
For example, we d post a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001. the customer would bid an option price and a transport rate
We d look at both components under a publicly posted evaluation method to decide who wins
I.e., we may post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so long as the transport rate bid is above "x"
Seems pretty straightforward, and we ought to be able to clarify this adequately in our answer to protests
