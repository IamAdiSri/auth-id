Unless we have bought something that I m not aware of, I don t believe TW or NN has any assets or operations in Louisiana and therefore should not be subject to the referenced tax
As far as other jurisdictions, I don t expect that we d have a problem with in-kind payment as an additional payment option
On TW, which has no fuel tracker, in kind tax payment probably wouldn t help us
Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes in kind and stick them in the tracker
We probably couldn t do that until the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our base rates at some representative level
