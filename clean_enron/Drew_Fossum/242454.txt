How about Thursday or Friday, June 1 or 2 for a round of golf?
I m in HOU all wk and the end of the wk looks pretty light
I d be happy to venture out west to your Katy/San Antonio nick of the woods if you guys are available
Hill, are you gonna be in Houston around then?
If so, can you sneak the clubs past your wife?
Please advise
DF PS: I met with Paul Bieniawski and his new storage group today
Do you guys know how he parted terms with the Frogs?
