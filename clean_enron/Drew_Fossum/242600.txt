Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon
He s pretty gung ho, and also alluded to several other projects he s got on the front burner (gas-fired power deals)
He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in
Have you ever known a project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???
I look forward to talking on Tuesday
DF
