I m OK with it, thanks to some coaching from Jeff
I would suggest that our marketers specifically mention to all interested bidders (especially Texaco) that the lottery tiebreaker is clearly identified in the posting and if they want to be there to witness it they better call us because we don t send out engraved invitations
Good luck
