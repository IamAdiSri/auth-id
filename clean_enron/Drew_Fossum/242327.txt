I just talked to Cynthia Sandherr about this and she was partly up to speed
They have been fighting with the CFTC to keep it from extending its jurisdiction to Enron Online and to all the financial products Enron sells
We apparently have a bill pending to lock the CFTC in and keep it from going after energy-related financial products
Cynthia was not aware of any potential collaboration between CFTC and FERC designed to push FERC into the role of regulator of these markets (with CFTC pulling the strings behind the scenes)
Cynthia was cranky about this possibility and will follow up
