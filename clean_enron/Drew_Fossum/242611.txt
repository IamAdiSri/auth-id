The following is a memo from accounting containing some new accounting codes you should be aware of
I should warn you that your timesheets must be approved by your supervisor; therefore, Code 5604 should not be used
It has come to our attention recently that many of you have been turningin timesheets that specify large amounts of "Miscellaneous?
UnproductiveTime" (Code 5309)
To our department, unproductive time isn t a problem.What is a problem, however, is not knowing exactly what you are doingduring your unproductive time
Attached below is a sheet specifying atentative extended job code list based on our observations of employeeactivities
The list will allow you to specify with a fair amount of precision whatyou are doing during your unproductive time
Please begin using this jobcode list immediately and let us know about any difficulties youencounter
Thank you,Accounting
