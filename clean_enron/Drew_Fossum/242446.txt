At the suggestion of Robert Jones (you remember him--one of the growing legion of ex-GPG HR representatives), I interviewed a lady named Emma Caplan yesterday
She is the wife of a guy that Enron Networks brought over to Houston from London
She is a "Solicitor" in the English legal system, and got her law degree at the University of Wales
She has not taken an American bar exam but may be able to take DC or New York
For some reason related to practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can t take the TX bar until she has gotten a US law degree
This person is very bright, personable, and enthusiastic
She is extremely interested in working for Enron, either as a lawyer once she gets her license squared away, or in a paralegal or analyst position until then
I left a copy of her resume with Emily, and I d ask that she please forward it to each of you
If any of you have need for such an individual or have ideas she should pursue within Enron (or outside Enron), please call Robert or myself
Thanks
DF
