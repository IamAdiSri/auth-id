If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this
We ll need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the "shared facilities."
Also, if you decide to go forward, don t do it until 1-1-2000 so we don t have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this quarter
Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we ll arrange a briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we ll make sure we understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is up
Please call with any questions
Thanks
