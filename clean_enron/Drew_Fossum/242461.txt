I m OK with the language, but I want to make sure everyone is OK on the concept
When we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations with ECS that I wasn t a part of) we rejected Courtney s proposal to reduce our up front payment by $500,000
He was to come back and propose a monthly quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to the $500,000, but I don t recall that we agreed to it
Did we intend to leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ECS should take or were we content to cover ECS at 100 cents on the dollar?
I am advised that the Btu number in the letter would allow ECS to get the full $500,000 of up front value
Rod and Steve--this one is up to you and I think its totally a question of whether we want to argue for some more $$ because I can t think of any other open issue with ECS on this or any other deals that we might be able to trade
