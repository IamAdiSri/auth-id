I ve got a meeting set up with Knippa at 10:00 on Thursday
Susan, please join me as Nemec will be there and he and you had most of the back and forth on the confidentiality issue
Either Steve or Kevin need to give me some sense of our authority
Any thoughts on that??
Is the number still $200,000?
What would we be willing to settle for?
Is a renegotiation of the existing deal in the works anyway as part of the expansion scenarios?
I ll have martha set up a meeting Thur
am to discuss before we talk to Knippa
