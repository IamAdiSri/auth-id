Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address the concerns stated in FERC s order approving the Gallup project
We may or may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file
The substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement
Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have
We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb. or so
Thanks
DF
