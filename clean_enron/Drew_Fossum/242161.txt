A couple of issues strike me as particularly important to report on tomorrow: (1) the TW train wreck--possible insurance coverage and strength of any claim against the railroad
We ought to talk to Lou to make sure we have the latest info as I haven t talked to him since Thursday
(2) Status of possible litigation involving OneOk
I don t think anyone has reported to Stan on the threatening noise from ONeOk about Praxair s rejection of the OneOk force majeure letter
I m sure MKM (or Dan on her behalf) will report that we are getting the strangers contract ready to send out, but she may not mention the Winston conversation with Charlie Graham
I ll check the bullets again to see if anything else jumps out
Talk to you at 8:30
