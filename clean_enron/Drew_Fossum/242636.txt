I just talked to Frank about my revised draft of the rehearing request
Susan, you will be pleased to learn that he has successfully talked me out of starting world war 3 with the FERC
I ve asked Frank (and Steve) to massage the draft to avoid a frontal challenge to FERC s disclosure policies and then to work with you to get it finalized
The plan is to carve out a limited exception to the normal disclosure rules given that the Gallup case is over and there is no pressing need for disclosure in advance of the normal discount report filing
Thanks
DF
