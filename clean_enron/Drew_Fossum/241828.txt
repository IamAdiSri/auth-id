DFAll: Please take a look at this article
El Paso s inartful internal documents are creating the same kind of fun for them that Microsoft had during the recent antitrust unpleasantness
I know that we can t control the way people think about issues such as market behavior, price strategy, etc
We can, however, remind ourselves and our clients to be very precise and careful in the way we talk about, and particularly, write about, such issues
I d like each of us and our clients to keep problems like El Paso s and Microsoft s in mind when we put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard
Thanks
