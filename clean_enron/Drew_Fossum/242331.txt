Come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets whacked
What a weird deal that is
Anyway, when do you think the new IMacs will be out in stores?
I still havent got around to buying Sandra her IMac and now she thinks she wants the IMac notebook so its a good thing I didn t do this last month
Do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old ones out?
