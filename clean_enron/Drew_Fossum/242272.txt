In case you haven t already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two year anniversary with the company
The good Lord willing (and with Stan s and Mike s continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two most recent and very illustrious predecessors
Given your meteoric career tracks, however, I m not sure you guys would view that as a huge accomplishment
Hope all goes well with you both
Adios from the big O. DF
