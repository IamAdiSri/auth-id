First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done today
As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts
This thing went from Dave and Kent s idea to you guys execution in about two days, even with a (slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream sales
Great job!
Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done in the future
The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis
If Gas Control verifies that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate
Gas Control should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented if the need ever arises
Today s deal is a great example of that as we actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure management issues
If there are ever any questions about when such deals are appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, Susan, or Maria a call
Again, great job!
