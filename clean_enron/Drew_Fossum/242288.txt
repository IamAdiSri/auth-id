Attached is my redline of your Sat
draft
In addition to the revisions in the doc, I have a few questions and concerns:1
On the segmenting section, I think it is a fine legal argument, but it lacks something
What is our "or else" position?
Does the Global Settlement give us any FERC-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue?
I m not suggesting that we should trigger a FERC out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should consider threatening to use it
I m afraid we come across as whiny and FERC s position will likely be "so what, what are you going to do about it?"
If we have no arguable "FERC-out" and the only "or else" we have is that we ll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal, I m for leaving the draft as-is
We can make our appeal threat more direct on rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.2
On the arbitrage argument, I ve taken out any reference to an example and softened the verbiage a bit
I want to leave in the references to the arbitrage issue, however, because FERC understands the problem and believes it is widespread
We don t need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).3
Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement?
If so, we d better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting section
Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won t play well
It is my understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback resolution deal so I hope this won t be a problem
4
On FN 20, I d suggest we use Vig s data and chart for May of 2000
The arb opportunity is huge and clear
We reference in the FN that we use all six of the Gas Daily price points, and I think Vig used just 3
What s the right answer?
Good work everyone--please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it should be good to go
