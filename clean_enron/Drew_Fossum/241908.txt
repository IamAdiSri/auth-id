Shit--I knew I forgot something!
My boss leaves for good on April one, so I ll be spending 3 or so days a wk in Hou starting now
I ll be the VP and General Counsel of Enron Transportation Services, which is the division that runs all the pipelines
Yeeha
I agree about getting together--when you coming down to visit the sister in law?
Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a boondoggle
Also, I ll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?
