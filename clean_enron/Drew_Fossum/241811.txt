This may be a good idea, but lets not forget that BP is the entity formerly known as "BP Amoco" which, if I m not mistaken, is the home of Jeff Hooligan
That guy sees evil in every pipeline deal,a nd may not have even known that his commercial people were doing deals with TW
I d like to think that the commercial people at BP have more clout than Hooligan and Kathy Edwards, but I wouldn t bet the ranch on that
