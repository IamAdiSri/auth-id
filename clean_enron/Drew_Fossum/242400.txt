It s against my nature, but I m getting pretty close to giving up
Attached is a draft letter to Langley punting the project
I ve tried to sugar coat it as much as possible so he doesn t get pissed off and automatically go to El Paso if he does somehow get the project built
The letter is based on the assumption that we will call them first to explain where we are
Also, I ve assumed that we won t send Dennis any of the data from EE&CC or ENA
I think we can chat generally on the phone and give them the ballpark results without actually sending the schedules to him
Please give me a call so we can help Steve with his script for when he calls Langley
(did you notice how I disappear when things start to go south?)
Talk to you soon
DF
