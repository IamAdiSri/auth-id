Hey--how the hell are you?
Still having fun and living large in the big apple?
Things are great on the prarie--Huskers are No
1 in the nation (I m actually talking about college womens volleyball since I refuse to watch professional Husker football) and wife and small chicks are doing great
As to SD firm, I ve almost hired Lynn Jackson Schultz and LeBrun a couple of times and then ended up not needing them
I think its the biggest firm in SD (big whoop) and is pretty well thought of
I went to college with a partner in their Sioux Falls office named Jon Sogn
He s a commercial litigator and a pretty good guy
Good luck and hope all goes well
