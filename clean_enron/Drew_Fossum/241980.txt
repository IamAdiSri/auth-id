If the condition in OneOk s release tied to KN s settlement is "simply unacceptable" to ONeOk, then there is no deal unless we simultaneously receive the $$ from KN and OneOk and simultaneously sign the agreements
We will need to set up a closing type of event (not necessarily in one city, over the phone and fax is ok) and hold each other hostage until all the paper is signed and wire transfers received
Just in case she s curious, my position is we don t sign the release until the wire transfer is in our bank
They can take the risk of the deal falling apart at the last minute--I don t think we should
