That was an interesting little conversation
I came back down and looked for you guys but you had both split
We should take a few minutes and plug John in on what happened at the end of that meeting when the power issues came up
I m somewhat surprised at Bill s reaction, but what the hell, now we can run with Cunningham, and we know MKM s pulse on Hubbard (and Bill s)
Pretty damn good end to the week, all things considered
