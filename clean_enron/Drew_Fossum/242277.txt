Interesting
I remember vaguely that we had some concern with how VAR was calculated
I recall that Dave Neubauer didn t think that we were doing it right for TW
Do you remember this issue?
If so, does this change address the same issue?
Also, I ll line up a meeting today or tomorrow on the TW options filing in general, and we can discuss the customer meeting and also touch on this internal controls issue
