Reed and Lana, thanks again for a great stay in the hills!
We all had a blast and I m happy to report that Britt and Tina are bragging to their little classmates about their newfound skiing prowess!
Next thing you know they ll be starring in a Warren Miller video!
Have a great time in BC and say hi to Brad and Jen for us
