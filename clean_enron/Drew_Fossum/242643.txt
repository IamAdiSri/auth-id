Susan s draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the Commission
To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I m having Martha type up my vitriol
Please hold off on detailed comments on Susan s draft unless you ve already finished them
I ll circulate a revised draft to you all later today
In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in expansion cases
I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid
treatment (even if only for a limited time)
Lets talk
Thanks
