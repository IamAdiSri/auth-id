Hey I m watching your fair city on the tube--I suppose you are at the NCAA final
I m stuck down here in Houston again--been down here at least 3 days every week for a month
Sandra digs it--at least I m out of her face
She was down here last week with me for 3 days looking at schools and houses with the 3 girls
That car was full of bitching, whining and crying
And the kids got a little cranky too
Gonna come and visit us???
We ll probably move in August--bring your dad s pickup and you can help!
What a great time to move when its 200 degrees and the fire ants and poisonous lizards are in full frenzy
Ugh
We ve gotta hook up with you guys before then
We re out for Easter week, but we ll need a quick road trip eventually
It would also be cool if you guys want to come down--Omaha would seem like Cancun after the winter you ve had!
Take care dude
DF
