I m OK with this agreement
Christine, I appreciate your explanation of how we developed the rate
Hopefully, once FERC approves our purchase and sale of options, we can price them as a stand alone service
For now, including the optionality as a bundled component of the total discounted rate--as we did here--is appropriate
