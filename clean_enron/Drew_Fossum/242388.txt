Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law bullets this morning
A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I m not sure how recent)
LG&E s gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into Northern was approx
180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000
Rockey and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability
The unexpected (and unmetered) deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period
Accordingly, I assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern s PRA and so should not affect earnings
I m not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter
