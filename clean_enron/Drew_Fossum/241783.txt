I am advised that some of you have not exhibited the requisite amount of "pep."
For lawyers and paralegals, you need to pick your reviewers online if you haven t already done so
5 or 6 would be sufficient althought the computer lets you pick up to 10
For those of you who picked more than 5 or 6 I have reduced that number, based on my thoughts about which of your chosen reviewers have had the most direct contact with you and are most likely to give a thorough review
Let me know if you think I really blew it
For secretaries, the online stuff is optional
If you don t use it, I will solicit input from the people you work with like I have in the past and consolidate it with my own comments on one form
Thanks
DF
