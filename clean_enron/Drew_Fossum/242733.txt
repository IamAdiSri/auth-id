Interesting
I ll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA s questions and comments
I think we can eliminate the specific cross references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?
(that s a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern)
Thanks
