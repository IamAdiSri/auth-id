I am troubled by your report
Perhaps we need to threaten to revoke the anmesty and impose sanctions for noncompliance?
Or deputize someone mean to search file cabinets?
In all seriousness, would all of you please remind your troops of the importance of this effort, as I will with my folks
Rick, thanks for the hard work and perseverance on this
