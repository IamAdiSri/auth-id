Thanks for the opportunity
I m V.P
and General Counsel of Enron Transportation and Storage, and its operating companies, Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co
I m stationed in Omaha, Nebraska
I practiced law in D.C. for 12 years before FERC and other state and federal regulatory agencies and the courts
As for objectives, I d like to see the group facilitate dialogue and work toward consistency on regulatory strategy, as well as serve as a forum for sharing practical "best practices" experience Enron people have gained around the world
I look forward to meeting you!
