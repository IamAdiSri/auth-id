John, great to hear that you are still doing the Lord s work on this case!
Sounds like you have things well in hand and that the appeal argument went well
Good luck on this one and please let me know how it turns out--in fact, please send me a copy of the appellate decision when issued at this email address or by mail at 1111 S. 103d St. Omaha Nebraska, 68124
Thanks
