Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political winds
I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate
I also agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under NGA section 4/5
To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc
I ll talk to you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss
Thanks
