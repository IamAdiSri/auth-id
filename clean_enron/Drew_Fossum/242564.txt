I m sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of activity lately related to Enron s evaluation of possible acquisitions
John Goodpasture s group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking at a number of potential deals
While these deal evaluation projects have become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are extremely confidential
Even after a potential seller has announced that it is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential
I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the future
If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact s company or assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not permitted to discuss potential acquisitions
Please be aware that the confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees of the target company
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do not hesitate to give me a call
Thank you for your assistance
DF
