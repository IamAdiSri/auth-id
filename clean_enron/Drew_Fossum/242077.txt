Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the line?
If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal
border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 775 lbs?
Lets talk to McShane tomorrow
