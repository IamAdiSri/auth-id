I don t have a problem supporting the concept generally
Since they took the trouble to ask for our help, its probably the right thing to do politically and relationship-wise
On the substance, I doubt this will do them or us much good in the long run as FERC will just ignore us all if pipelines start acting as cheerleaders for each others proposals
Will they ghost write it or do you need someone to draft it up?
