I don t know what she is even talking about
Why does MKM have someone "coordinating" the migration to Windows 2000?
Doesn t the IT dept
do that, or has MKM taken over the IT dept?
What "issues" could we possibly have????
Even if we had issues (which I most certainly do not, in spite of what everyone says) how could we possibly get the IT juggernaut to pay attention?
We are all helpless to stop it in spite of our puny efforts to "coordinate" or "raise issues"
