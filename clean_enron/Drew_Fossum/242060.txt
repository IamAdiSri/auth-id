Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st
(I m not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be)
Does that have any financial consequences or other consequences for us?
For example, on TW, certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, right?
NN s tariff doesn t have a similar mechanism, but we may have common law exposure
We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk tomorrow or Wed
This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for the 1st -4th were not FM
Any thoughts?
