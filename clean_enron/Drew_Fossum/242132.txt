I m not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a service for Citizens
We can t actually buy the assets without a FERC certificate, but that s not what you are suggesting
I can think of one example on NN in which Northwestern Pub
Service owns a some branch lines and we operate them
Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream out of the regulated pipeline entity
Since TW doesn t have a rate case until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate entitiy until we get down the road a ways
