Sorry, I read the other email first--you guys have me covered quite well
I think the staff meeting formerly known as Mikes is on Tuesday Mar
3, right Emily??
I didn t have anything on my calendar on the 12th
Emily, you might want to send an email around reminding everyone of the Mar
3 all-lawyers meeting and the secretary meeting just in case some people are assuming I ll schedule mine at different times
Thanks all
