I agree with Danny s email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 15,000hp motor
It was my understanding that the long lead time items were going to be ordered shortly (if they haven t been already) and that we d take the financial risk
If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won t be the critical path item they usually are
I ve reviewed the FERC application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite things
Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional capacity
I ll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything possible to expedite these efforts
