I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion
I was pretty impressed with her
The only down side is that her inability to sit for the Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position
I suggested that she also look into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas is
I ll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman regaring possible positions in GPG
Have you thought about Steve Kean s group?
They might be able to use someone like Emma
I plan to write her in a couple of weeks to follow up with any additional leads I ve found
Enjoyed shootin the shit with you, as always!
