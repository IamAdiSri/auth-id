Great
I ve put in a couple of minor changes--pls crank out a clean (non redlined) copy and email it back to me
For now, lets take out the sentence indicating Sempra s agreement
Also, delete the privilege header
I want Georgetta to have a clean copy she can circulate internally in her shop
In my cover email to her I ll suggest the sentence I d like to be able to include
MKM and others--please let me know if I m good to go on sending this to Georgetta
Thanks
