Thanks
I ll call Tino back and tell him not to fret about what he heard from Maddox --I know Tino and Dennis knew about the Cobisa project and I think he believed Maddox was working on yet another project
I can get Tino comfortable without breaching our confid
agreement with Maddox by just telling Tino that we understand there is just one project down South of our target location, not two
Also, I ll let Tino know that early April looks like the best time to get together to talk numbers and we ll call to set it up when we are ready
