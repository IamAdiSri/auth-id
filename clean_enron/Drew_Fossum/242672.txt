I agree with you that par
4 doesn t give NMNG anything beyond what the tariff and general contract law gave them
The "subject to agreement by Transwestern" language is redundant since the previous clause says " by mutual written agreement."
Additionally, its confusing and innacurate because the "provided, however, that" clause isn t even binding if we mutually agree to eliminate it
I therefore think we ought to take par
4 out, or at least remove the "provided however" clause
I don t agree that we can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release
We can mutually agree to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap
release
I suppose we would need to use cap
release if the termination or reduction of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another shipper, however
I would propose one change to Par
3 just to make the discount more clear
The par
talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary receipts
I d add this, after the words "Appendix A" at the end of the current first sentence:"and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A
The discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in Transwestern s East of Thoreau (EOT) area
"I m a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both the receipt and delivery end of the deal
Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made
I d like to eliminate par
4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the "provided however" clause
With these changes, I m OK with the contract
Thanks
