I guess you wouldn t want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures
You also wouldn t want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate issues
By process of elimination, I guess I m OK with NN issuing the guarantee
In my view, if Mavrix commercial strategies are unsuccessful and Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those dollars in Northern s next rate case
Thanks
