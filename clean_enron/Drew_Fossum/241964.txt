Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:1
Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.2
Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity posted (the 33,000/d)
I d like you to keep copies of those postings in your file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity
If we end up in a fight at some time, we ll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.3
All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan
For now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes
For Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures and MKM s group and I should be advised as a matter of course
Thanks
DF
