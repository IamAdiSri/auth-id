Excellent!
I hope Briden s project attracts fewer vultures than Dennis Langley s. I need to go to Midland on the afternoon of the 12th, so could meet in Houston conveniently on the morning of the 12th or anytime 10 am or later on the 11th
I could meet on the 10 th after 10, but less conveniently
Just let Martha know what the plan is and she ll deploy me
Also, when you say they want TW to "build, own and operate the plant" you mean the gas pipeline facilities, not the power plant, right?
Must be because $20 mil
would be a pretty cheap power plant
Thats a pretty cheap pipeline also for the length--about 40 miles, right?
