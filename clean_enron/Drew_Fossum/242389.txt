Per our discussion, I ve modified the letter to remove reference to the monthly pack agreement and made a couple of other minor changes
I wasn t able to get ahold of Bill on Friday afternoon to discuss who will sign, so for now I ve left it with signature blocks for Bill and Rod only
I hope we are getting closer to the target here and look forward to discussing it with you further on Monday
Thanks again for the illumination on AA s intent on the earlier draft
