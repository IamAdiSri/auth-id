Thanks Bob
I d suggest that you handle the points in the first and second paragraphs of your email with Gary Peng, including updating the verbiage as you deem appropriate to address the North Dakota, weather, and mileage issues
Please send to Mike Moran and myself the changes you propose (including the numbers)
We have already modified the language you reference in your third paragraph (per Michele Winckowski), so that s taken care of
Mike, you or I should let Rex know that a couple of these additional tweaks are coming through this other channel
One of us can then send them directly to Rex if that would be helpful
