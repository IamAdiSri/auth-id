Leslie Lawner called and asked if TW could help with the funding of this organization
As you will recall, the "NM First" group has taken positions on right of way issues that are consistent with TW/Enron s view on Indian right of way issues
Leslie asked if we could kick in $1000
I leave this to you guys to weigh in on--If you think it s worthwhile, let me know and one of us can get back to Leslie
I m happy to help out with the funding if you think it would be useful
