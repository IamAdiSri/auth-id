Looks good to me--and I agree that we ought to use if for internal purposes only
If people at the customer meeting want more detail than you guys are able to provide orally, we could consider adding detail to the FERC filing or even sending them some additional explanation that we may or may not decide to file with FERC
Good luck today!
