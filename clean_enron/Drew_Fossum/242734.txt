Actually, Mike, the cost benefit for you guys is pretty good since the hassle is mostly on the legal and regulatory folks where it belongs!
Seriously, the quarterly FERC filing I mentioned needs to be done anyway as I understand it because we use it to apprise FERC of various changes in our compliance
Since Rich s folks out there don t ordinarily have access to "confidential transportation related information" except maybe for occasional advance info on operational problems or outages, there shouldn t be much need for training or risk of accidental disclosures
There is no filing fee or other out of pocket cost, and we are, as always, eager to help with any deals that might bring some value to ET&S or Corp. (and who knows how valuable a little sucking up to EES might be in the long run!?)
Just let us know what you decide to do and we ll get the paperwork done
Thanks
