Sorry you weren t able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak!
It was epic
Lots of birds (the wild variety, not pen raised and tied down like at Pheasant Haven!)
We saw literally 1500-2000 birds over three days of hunting, and limited out every day
Got my first double--two shots, two birds, nothun but net
You gonna be at the mgt conf?
I d love to get caught up with you and share some new tales of woe from the pipeline group
PS, I met Angie Green yesterday--very sharp young lady
She said to say hi to you and Nicole
Adios
DF
