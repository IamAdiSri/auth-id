I d be happy to give you some specific feedback on this project
I think you did a good job of bringing some focus to a project that badly needed focus
I was particularly pleased with how you vectored off from what started out as a computer system enhancement project and instead you brought home a solution that allows us to improve things immediately with manual processes and then upgrade to a system if we choose
You showed a lot of creativity and flexibility in adapting to the changing project focus
I really valued your thoroughness in getting input from all interested parties
Your legwork up front made it a lot easier to get needed buy-in when we finally brought management in
The product was timely and I expect it to deliver on my expectations, although the implementation will be the key
Thanks again for the good work, and expect me to be a frequent customer
