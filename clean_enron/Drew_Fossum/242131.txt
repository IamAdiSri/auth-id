Tino called this morning with a quick report
They are still negotiating with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky
The size of the plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me
Tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart
He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it related to the pipeline right of way
The have a binding 20 year agreement with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly payment
I m not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc
The question is whether we are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar
I told Tino I d give him a call next week to let him know
At minimum, I d suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they ve got and advise us on what its worth
Your thoughts?
DF
