ON further reflection, if Mavrix is to be a wholly owned sub of Enron Pipeline Company (or whatever the current name is of the top-tier ETS entity) then that entity ought to issue the guaranty
Mavrix intends to buy capacity from TW and possibly NN
It would be innappropriate to have TW issue the guaranty if TWs guaranty would likely operate in favor of TW
Same for NN
