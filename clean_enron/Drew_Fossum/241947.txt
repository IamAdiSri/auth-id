I m on a conf
call with Minnegasco from 8-10 Friday
Please go forward without me and I ll circle back in later
My view is that we need to look hard at a second expansion project, maybe jointly with Questar or someone else (Mojave?)
that goes all the way to the market
We may be semi-serious about the within-Cal
portion of the project, but it would be great potential leverage against the utilities and CPUC
