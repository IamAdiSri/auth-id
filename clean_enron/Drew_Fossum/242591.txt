I got a call from Tino earlier today (right after our meeting on Pueblo) but could only talk to him for a few minutes before I had to jump off
I did let him know that Kevin or Lorraine would be calling to talk about info that we need to complete our analysis of the economics
He also let me know that they are looking at another power plant project in the SW Power Pool and want to discuss with us
Thanks
