He s not a nazi, he s a commie
Actually he s a democrat but such subtle distinctions escape me
What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past
(they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of Trade, etc.)
He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of products
The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of the CFTC s arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based on the CFTC s guidance
I assume that Kean s group is on top of this, but I haven t had the chance to check yet
I talked to a guy in the DC office about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be sure they are aware of this leftist plot
I can t remember his name just now, but he works for Cynthia Sandherr, I think
I ll let you know what is going on after I talk to those folks
