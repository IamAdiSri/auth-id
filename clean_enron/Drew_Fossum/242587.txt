Sounds reasonable to me
When do we sign?
Seriously, this just confirms in my mind that Langley isn t looking very closely at the economics of the deal because he doesn t have any capital or O & M numbers (or heat rates) on the generation equipment so he has no idea how thick or thin the margins might be on this project
Once we are able to show him some economics he will presumably be in a position to be reasonable on the issues discussed below
If he s not willing to be reasonable, we re done talking to him
