Dave, I ve had a technical conference come up at FERC on the 20th in a matter that I m responsible for
Bill strongly suggested that I go to DC
Now, I may not be a rocket scientist, but I see pretty clearly the wisdom of following Bill s advice
I ve let Mike Moran know and at Bill s suggestion, asked him if he d like a substitute to stand in for me (maybe Lou Soldano?)
Judging from the list of participants in this PRC, I assume I was partly an ET&S representative and partly a GPG law representative
I note that ET&S is already pretty well represented with Neubauer, Julia and Mike Nelson
Without me, there is noone from law, but our people have already been PRC d anyway
I ll leave it to you and Mike to decide if my spot needs to be filled with someone from GPG law
Sorry about this--just one more bit of evidence that I "have issues."
