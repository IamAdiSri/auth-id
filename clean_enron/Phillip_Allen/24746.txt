Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%
There are several reasons that I won t commit to this
Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns
What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years
The existing note does not come due until September 2009
That is a long time
The buyer may have sold the property
Interest rates may be lower
I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note
Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract
Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms
I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer
If we can t come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list.Email or call me later today.Phillip
