Lucy,#32 and #29 are fine
#28 paid weekly on 1/5
Then he switched to biweekly
He should have paid 260 on 1/12
Two weeks rent in advance
Instead he paid 260 on 1/19
He either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the middle of his two weeks
He is only paid one week in advance
This is not a big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.Here is an updated rentroll
Please use this one instead of the one I sent you this morning.Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.Phillip
