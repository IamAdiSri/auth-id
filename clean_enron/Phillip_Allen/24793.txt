George,I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation
Any day between March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don t want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough
The items I listed moved dramatically
Also, some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number
Let s try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning
