Greg,I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway
First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected
Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors"
I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living)
Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below
As I have mentioned, my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years
At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like Keith.Here is the article:Sector 2 plan geets boost from council By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter Home and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area
The San Marcos City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region
Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street)
Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan
Proposed changes to Weatherford s 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential
In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan
The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commercial" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping
A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan
However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway
Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue
While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford
Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer s plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds
"I d rather say "no and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said
Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut
"It seems to me we re asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there," Mihalkanin said
A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move
Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting
Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise
Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole
"This is not a victory for one side or the other," said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford s initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City of San Marcos
We started out with all R-1...we ve come a long way."
