Is AMF willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge June 29th as the day they were supposed to close or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on July 18th?
Of course, I would prefer to close as soon as possible
I received the fax from the stagecoach
I am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to April 20th
