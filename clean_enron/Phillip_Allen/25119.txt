Larry, Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities
I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street
that were built by Reagan Lehmann
22 Units were sold for around $2 million
($182,000/duplex)
I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180 s. Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?
He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan
My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex
As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested
Call or email with your thoughts.Phillip
