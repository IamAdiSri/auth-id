Ina,Gracie finally sent the CPE credit information
Thanks for staying on top of it.Is there somewhere online that I can find my YTD wages and taxes withheld
I know it was on the pay stub from last week, but I threw that one away before I realized I needed the info
If I can t find it online, can you get payroll to print out another check stub from 8/31
I need to do some income tax calculations.Thanks,Phillip
