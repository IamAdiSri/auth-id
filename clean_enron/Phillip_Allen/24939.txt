Julie, The numbers for January are below: Actual flows X gas daily spreads $ 463,000 Actual flow X Index spreads $ 543,000 Jan. value from original bid $1,750,000 Estimated cost to unwind hedges ($1,000,000) Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no more than $1,500,000
I want your input on how to negotiate with El Paso
Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or unwind costs?
Phillip
