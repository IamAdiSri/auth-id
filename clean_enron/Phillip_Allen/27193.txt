jacques,I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing
The total is $7,328.87
Do you need to incorporate this number is the release or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference
Do they have an executable copy of the release?
I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now
I don t want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments
Phillip
