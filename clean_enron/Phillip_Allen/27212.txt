Jeff,I don t understand what you want me to do with this letter
Regarding the utilities, you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don t own for sometime now
I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo s while negotiating the release
I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday
The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week
Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo s owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs
Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected
The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip
Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release
Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes
I expect to have that done by Friday.I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won t sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday
