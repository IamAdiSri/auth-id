Lucy,Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages
There are alot of overages
It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather.You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet
We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don t want to exceed their cap
I will write something today.Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting.Phillip
