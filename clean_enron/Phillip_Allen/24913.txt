Reagan,Just wanted to give you an update
I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12
Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings
At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing
Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid
Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.Phillip
