George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit
Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation
At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split
However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million
Builder doesn t benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder
2
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45
I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip
