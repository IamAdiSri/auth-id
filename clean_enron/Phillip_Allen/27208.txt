Carlos,Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?
I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly
Here is my situation
I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago
I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th
I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000
See calculations below:Sales price: 2,100,000Purchase price 1,200,000Fees&Devel costs 500,000Profit 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify
First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago
I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project
We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me
The loan still exist
I am an 80% limited partner
Another investor is the other limited partner
We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner
We intend to develop the property
Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second, I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000
I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing
I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property
My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name
Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen 8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626
