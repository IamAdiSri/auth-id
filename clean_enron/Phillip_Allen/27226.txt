Adrianne,Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position
I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge
The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.Thomas was working as an equity market maker
He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise
He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades
The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires
I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.Phillip
