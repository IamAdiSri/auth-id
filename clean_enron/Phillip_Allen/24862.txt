Thanks for the response
I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step
I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan.He got back to me yesterday with his first draft
He took my plan and improved it
I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans
While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list
Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners
I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th
Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day?
Also can you provide some references?Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid
Phillip
