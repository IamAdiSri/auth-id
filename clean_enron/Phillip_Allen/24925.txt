Naomi,The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October
He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category
I just don t want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.Call me with questions
