Don,I was out last week
Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to Mark Whitt in Denver
Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta s desk or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES
I don t understand why your people don t contact the desk directly.Phillip
