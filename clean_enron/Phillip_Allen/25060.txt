Wade, I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation

Lucy can t hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesn t live up to it
If you decide to buy a small truck and you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your income.Phillip
