Jacques,The agreement looks fine
My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"
Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required
Did I loan them $1,300,000?
I thought it was less.Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study
Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants
I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer
I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants
The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above
Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip
