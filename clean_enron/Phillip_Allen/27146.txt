Jacques,Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a corporation
Several CPA s assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk
Therefore, we are ready to finalize the agreements
What is the next step?
Do we just execute the copies we have?I haven t heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb
I keep leaving messages.Phillip
