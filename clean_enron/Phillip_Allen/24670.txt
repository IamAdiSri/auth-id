Lucy, I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated
The critical information is 1
Move in or lease start date 2
Lease expiration date 3
Rent 4
Deposit If you have the info you can fill in these items 1
Number of occupants 2
Workplace All the new leases should be the long form
The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated back in October are #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38
I really need to get this by tomorrow
Please use the rentroll_1215 file to input the correct information on all these tenants
And email it to me tomorrow
You should have all this information on their leases and applications
Phillip
