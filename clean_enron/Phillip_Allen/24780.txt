The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles
Would you consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment and running a spinning video on the TV s. I think the equipment would be used much more
Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any time of day.Let me know if this is possible.Phillip AllenX37041
