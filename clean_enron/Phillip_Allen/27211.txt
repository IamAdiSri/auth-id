Faith,Two changes need to be made to the list
First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk
Second, Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G. I don t know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC
