Thanks for the information
It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned.I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January
I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock
I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%)
Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?Thank you for looking into this issue.Phillip
