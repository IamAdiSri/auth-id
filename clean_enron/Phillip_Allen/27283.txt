Here is lakeside in your format
Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note
My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering
Also expenses were higher
Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?
I would like to come see it again on Wednesday
I would be bringing 1 or 2 others
Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?Phillip
