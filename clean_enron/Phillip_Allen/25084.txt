I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind of exclusive with Paine Weber
I am starting to exercise now, but I am going to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex
What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.Thanks,Phillip
