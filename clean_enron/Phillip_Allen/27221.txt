Jeff, The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20
You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000
It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes
