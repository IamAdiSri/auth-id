Cary,Here is the picture of the house I have in mind
I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley
A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen
More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry
Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive
I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco
Also the front porch would be smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000
I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work
As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft
