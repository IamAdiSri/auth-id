Larrry,I realize you are disappointed about the project
It is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses
The only item from your list that I need further clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions
You mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land
I agree that you should be refunded any cash investment
My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document.Phillip
