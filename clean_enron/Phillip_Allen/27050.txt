Kirk,I would modify this document slightly
The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"
However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section
I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged
Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools
Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section
The third section would include the roles and accounting basics
