Bob,I do have a survey of the sight at home
I will get you a copy tomorrow.Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need
The website is below
I believe the relevant contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (Seller s Disclosure of Property Condition)
A coworker is about to close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used
