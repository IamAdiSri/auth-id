Reagan,I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?What role would you play in obtaining financing?
Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?
Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet
I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback
I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project
As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%
I am not thrilled about such a low return
I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%
Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections
I am not discounting those services
I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.Phillip
