Gary,Here is a photograph of a similar house
The dimensions would be 56 Wide X 41 Deep for the living area
In addition there will be a 6 deep two story porch across the entire back and 30 across the front
A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25 on the left side
The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch
