Jeff,I reviewed your revised offer sheet
I am OK with the effective income of $484K
Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number
The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on
$484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI
I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon
He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization
See the attached spreadsheets
