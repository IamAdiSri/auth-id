Gary,Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?
In April you worked up a quote for $20,000
The dimensions of the house have not changed
The quote given last week was over $26,000
Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?
I need help understanding this increase.Phillip Allen713-853-7041
