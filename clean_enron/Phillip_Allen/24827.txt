Lucy,Here is the rentroll.My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent
Any special reasons?It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40
If you want to run an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.I will write you a letter of recommendation
When do you need it?
You can use me as a reference
In the next two weeks we should really have a good idea whether the sale is going through.Phillip
