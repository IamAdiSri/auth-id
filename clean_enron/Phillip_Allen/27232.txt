Jeff,I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000
He is proposing to do work on nine buildings
From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse
I don t want to pay for any discretionary work
Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason
I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques
With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st
That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name
It needs to be clear that I will net that month s electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately
If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.Phillip
