Jacques,Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect?
They have both sent me agreements
The only paymentthat George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect
I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer.I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership
I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me
Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.Let me know what you think.Phillip
