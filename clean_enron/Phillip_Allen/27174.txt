Michael,I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options
Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future
The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place
They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn t offer the employees such as lending against vested options
It was worth a try.Phillip
