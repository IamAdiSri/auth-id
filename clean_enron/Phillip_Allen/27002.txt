Richard,I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included
So that reduces some of the savings
Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home
Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate
Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs
I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do
What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?
Radiant barrier?
More attic ventilation?
