Renee,I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last Thursday
I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be made off-cycle
However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit
Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?Thank you,Phillip Allen
