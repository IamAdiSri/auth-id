We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 to a 41.67 heat rate
We applied forward gas prices to historical loads
I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year
Prices seem low
Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices
What about a forecast for this November loads.Let me know what you think.Phillip
