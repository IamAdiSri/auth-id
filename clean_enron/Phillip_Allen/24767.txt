Jeff,Here is the application from SPB
I guess they want to use the same form as a new loan application
I have a call in to Lee O Donnell to try to find out if there is a shorter form
What do I need to be providing to the buyer according to the contract
I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey and a rentroll including deposits on Monday
