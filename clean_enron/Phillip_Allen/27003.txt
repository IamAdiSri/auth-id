Renee,Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units
It is clear that the payment will be made in shares
However, I still don t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares
The plan document under VII
Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."
Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.Thank you,Phillip Allen
