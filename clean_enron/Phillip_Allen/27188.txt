Jacques,Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb
This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo s and Success Real Estate
Don t they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?I certainly don t plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled
Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?
Is the ball in their court?Phillip
