Jeff,That is good news about Leander
Now for the stage
I would like to get it sold by the end of March
I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven
I don t need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien
I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.Checkout this spreadsheet.These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes
However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown
Having Lucy show it is not a good idea
I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property
My dad doesn t have the time and I don t trust Lucy or Wade to show it correctly
I would prefer for you to show it from now on
I will have the operating statements complete through December by this Friday
Phillip
