Karen,I interviewed Agustin Leon and Zoya Raynes
Here are my comments:Agustin Leon: Has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis
Programming and language skills
If not a trader could be an asset to research group.Zoya Raynes: Has already been through Salomon s rotational program
Her interest lean more towards marketing than trading
Seems very talented.I would recommend both candidates for further consideration.Phillip
