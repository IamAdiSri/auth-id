Greg,Something that I forgot to ask you
Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?Also let me know about the parking
The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code
The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem
They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.Phillip
