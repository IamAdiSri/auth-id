jeff,Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE or just above market
If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn t the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?
If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time
Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered
