Ned,Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value
The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees
Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year)
Demand charges only.I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not
Please call or email with comments.Phillip Allen
