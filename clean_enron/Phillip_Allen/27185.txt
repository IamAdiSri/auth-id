Kay,I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks
The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying
I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you
I guess he is technology challenged
The article was just one analyst s opinion
He can find dozens of articles just like it online
It was not important.On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week
Heather is very anxious about this
The only info we get is through the camp s website
Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day
We scan through to try and spot Kelsey
So far we have found her in one picture each day
It is kind of fun trying to find her
If you want to give it a try, go to their website at www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml>
Click on sports camp parent connection
There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day
See if you can find her.Pat and Gary s house looks like it is taking shape fast
The Meckels seem to do good work
I might have to reconsider using them for our house.We should be in town Friday
We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday
