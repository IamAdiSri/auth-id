Jay,I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets
They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location
You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041
Thanks for your help.Phillip
