George, I received the drawings
They look good at first glance
I will look at them in depth this weekend
The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which I cannot open
Please resend in excel or a pdf format
If you will send it to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend
Does this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?
I just want to get a feel for when you will start needing money
Phillip
