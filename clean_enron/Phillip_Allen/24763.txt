Lucy,Here is the 2/2 rentroll
The total does not equal the bank deposit
Your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to
If the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back.Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday
I will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll
Let s get this stuff clean today.Phillip
