Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline
I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range
I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done
It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding
If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release

Hopefully things will go smoothly.Phillip
