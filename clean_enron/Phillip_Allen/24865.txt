Reagan,I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th
However, my closing has been postponed
As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished.Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio
For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing
We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings
Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates
I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships
I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.Phillip Allen
