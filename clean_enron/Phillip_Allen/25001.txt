Kay & Neal,Thanks for remembering my birthday
You beat my parents by one day
The family is doing fine
Grace is really smiling
She is a very happy baby as long as she is being held.It sounds like your house is coming along fast
I think my folks are ready to start building
We will probably visit in late June or July
May is busy
We are taking the kids to Disney for their birthdays.Good luck on the house.Keith
