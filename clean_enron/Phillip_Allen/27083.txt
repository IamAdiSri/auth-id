Jeff,According to Kevin Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo s today to give a final blessing to the release
He doesn t foresee any issues
If they are ok with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person
I will be in San Marcos this weekend
Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well for me
He is proposing that time to the Kuo s. How does your schedule look?
It would be nice to finally put this behind us.Any word on a closing date for Leander?Phillip
