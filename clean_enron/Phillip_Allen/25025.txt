Lucy, I want to speak to Wade myself
He can call me at work or home
Or if you email me his number I will call him
I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance
I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office
Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays?
I think I can guess your answer
I might stop by this Friday.Phillip
