Jim,Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating
Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low
Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith
I don t believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at
Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time
