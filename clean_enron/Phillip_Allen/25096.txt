Brad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate
Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager
I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end
Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori
Let me know if there are any issues.Phillip
