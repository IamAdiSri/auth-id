Greg, I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office
The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold
Let me know what you think of this property
Also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.Phillip
