Jeff,My target is to get $225 back out of the stage
Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K
This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer
After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash
You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email
Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.Phillip
