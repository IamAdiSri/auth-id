Jeff,JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L
Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million
This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached
The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million)
This is probably money coming out of reserves
Besides that day there are many smaller differences
Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?
The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus
