Pam please review
I don t want to misrepresent your position to Greg.Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account
Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant s deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty
This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan
It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant
In my case this would be as of September 30th
I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001
The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently
Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001
Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation
First, section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan." This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply
Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distribution of all of the Participant s deferral accounts" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3
If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply
This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares
However, it states "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock". This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001
Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp
common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.30909Plan Administrators0909Section 7.1Number of shares09096,60009shares09096,60009shares0909096,600 sharesRelative share price0909$27.2309090909090909$83.13Phantom Stock Value0909$179,718090909090909$548,65810% Penalty090909-17,972090909 -60009090909-54,866Value to be distributed0909$161,74609096,000 shares090909$493,792Current stock price090909090909090909$10Distribution090909$161,74609096,000 shares09090949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair
If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply
The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout
In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue
I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.Sincerely,Phillip Allen 09090909090909090909
