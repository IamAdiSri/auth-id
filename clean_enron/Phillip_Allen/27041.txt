Richard,I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP s. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials
I already have my blueprints completed
What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP s with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep
The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget
I don t want to settle for a conventional stick built house
I was wondering about alternatives
Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP s. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec
He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels
But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money
I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.Thank you for your help.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041
