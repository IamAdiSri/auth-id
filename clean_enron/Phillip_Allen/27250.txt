Frank,The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position
Whatever the risk was prior should not matter
Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset
If the VAR calculation does not match the company s true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted
