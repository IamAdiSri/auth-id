Greg,I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format
The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000
But there is not a professional management company
Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000
However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit
This would yield an NOI of $240,000
Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn t look like the rents have a great deal of upside
The asking price is $2,700,000
Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap
Using the seller s NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap
The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project
The cost per square foot is 36.58
The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million
Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go
This property has not been on the market
So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it
If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million
It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants
Plus the location is by far the most convenient.Financing is the other consideration
I am assuming 25 year, 7%, and 25% down
What do you think could actually be achieved?
Can you put me in contact with a lender?I will follow up with a phone call.Thanks,Phillip
