Jeff, You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood
I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which I might become involved with Creekside
Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?
Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?
Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch?
I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet
Phillip
