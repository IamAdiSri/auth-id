Lucy,Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file
Moving on to 2/9, here are some questions:#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110
I can t tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit.#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95
Hopefully, he won t have a bad reaction.#20b Missed rent?#26 Has she paid any deposit or rent?#27 Missed rent?
