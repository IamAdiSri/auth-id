Bob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday
The hearing will be on January 8th
In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th
I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline
Sorry if I dropped the ball
On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition
It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space. You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room
Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost
Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers
This way you would not have to add a second staircase
The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction
In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback
Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up
From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition
The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded
That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing
Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible
Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea.I don t know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan
But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted
