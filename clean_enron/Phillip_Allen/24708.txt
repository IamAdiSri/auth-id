Lucy,Why did so many tenants not pay this week?#12 95#21 240#27 120#28 260#33 260Total 975It seems these apartments just missed rent
What is up?Other questions:#9-Why didn t they pay anything?
By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent should have been due on 12/12 of $220.#3-Why did they short pay?
