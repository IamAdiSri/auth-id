Lucy, Here is a rentroll for this week
The one you sent for 11/24 looked good
It seems like most people are paying on time
Did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income?
Go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units
If you need to lower the rent by $10 or $20 to get things full, go ahead
I will be out of the office on Thursday
I will talk to you on Friday.Phillip
