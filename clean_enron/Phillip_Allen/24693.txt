Frank,Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments
I have left several messages at your office to follow up
You mentioned that your plate was fairly full
Are you too busy to look at this project?
As I mentioned I would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding board for the key issues
Please email or call.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041
