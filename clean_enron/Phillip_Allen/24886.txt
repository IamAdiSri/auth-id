Johnnie,Thank you for meeting with me on Friday
I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system
I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you
In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations
The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale
I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.Please email your cost estimates when complete.Thank you,Phillip Allen
