Brenda, I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th
I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd
#29, College Station, TX 77845
I will go ahead and mail you another check
If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October
I know your concerns about the site plan
I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval
I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.Phillip
