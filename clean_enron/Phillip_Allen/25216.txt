Lucy,Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save
My only questions are:1
Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01
Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period
What is going on?2
Gilbert in #27-is he just late?
Here is a file for 12/08
