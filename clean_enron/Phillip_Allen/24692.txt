Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled
One for $150 and the other for $75
Which apartments?
20a or #13?
Utility overages for #26 and #44?
Where did you get these amounts?
For what periods?
What is going on with #42
Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling
I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes
If that doesn t work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor
Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property
This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don t want to run them off.I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn t check the total from the rentroll against the bank
Is this right?
Has the deposit been made yet?
A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.Phillip
