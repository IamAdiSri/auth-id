Jacques,Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?
The key business points are:1
Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2
Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3
The investors loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4
All parties are GP s but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5
60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs
Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses
Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping
The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours
We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements
The GP issue may need some tweaking
