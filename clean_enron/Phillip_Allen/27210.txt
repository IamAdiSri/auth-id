Jeff,Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed
I didn t make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount
I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time
Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week
If you want to modify this letter let me know
I am also faxing you a sign copy
Phillip
