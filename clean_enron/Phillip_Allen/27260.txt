Tim,Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz
He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May
It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170
Also the second half of April doesn t seem to have panned out as I expected
The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary
Can you email or call with some additional insight?Thank you,Phillip
