Mary,If we add both balances together the total is $1,140
I can spread it over 6 or 12 months
6 month payout would be $190/month
12 month payout would be $95/month
Your choice
I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so
Does $10/hr sound fair?
We can apply it to the loan.Phillip
