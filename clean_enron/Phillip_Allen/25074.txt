Lucy, Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping
First, I want to implement the following changes: 1
No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions
2
Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily 3
Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank 4
No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations
Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1
When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow highlighted items
I have questions about these items
Please gather receipts so we can discuss.Phillip
