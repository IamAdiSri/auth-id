Greg,I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed the deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreement
Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates
What will happen at closing?
Is the major problem with the appraisal that since the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute an additional 180,000 in equity?
If so, that is not good.You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously
Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not looking at old numbers
