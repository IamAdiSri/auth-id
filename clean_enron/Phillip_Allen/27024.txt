Renee,Thank you for the forms
I am trying to estimate my tax obligation
It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income
What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?
I thought those were already deducted
Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made
On the contrary, there are losses
