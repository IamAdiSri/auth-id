Mike & Tony,Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs
Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close
I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis
I don t know if this would be agreeable to you
Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think
If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections
I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations
However, we are leaning towards Kerrville
The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially
We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to our plan to move to San Marcos
I don t know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com
