Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company
I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him
Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider
Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk
This is my best guess
I will get back to you with more.Phillip
