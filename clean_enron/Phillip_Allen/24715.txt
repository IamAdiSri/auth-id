Larry,I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project
They need the following:Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.Builders resume listing similar projectsThe banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday
If we are interested in his loan, he would want to come see the site.If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along
You can send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).The broker is Jim Murnan
His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call him and send the documents to him directly.It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership agreement
I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon as possible
Please email or call with an update.Phillip
