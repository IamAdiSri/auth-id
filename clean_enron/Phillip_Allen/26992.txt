Steve,I need help determining how much margin the short options require
My account has a value of around $1,400,000
That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes
I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni s. I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account
Obviously, I don t want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.Please get back to me soon.Phillip
