Jacques,If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements
Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.I faxed those to you
Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment"
I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here
Thank you,Phillip
