Jacques,Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions
Assuming that it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents need to becompleted to convey the partnership done
I need to work with the engineer and architect to get things moving
I am planning on writing a personal check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts
Let me know if there is a reason I should not do this.Thanks for all your help so far
Between your connections and expertise in structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.Phillip
