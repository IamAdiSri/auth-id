Jerry,I had a couple of questions about the exchange.1
Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?2
The cash to be escrowed is approx
$650K
At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K
Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?3
