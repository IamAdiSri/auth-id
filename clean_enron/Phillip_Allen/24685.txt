Gentlemen, I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing
Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston
I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you
Can you please send it to him
His contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net
I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information
I hope to pull that together this afternoon
I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document
He was positive about his experience overall
He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor
I think we should discuss these procedures in advance
Let s continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.Phillip
