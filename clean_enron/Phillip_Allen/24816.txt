Jacques,George finally sent me some information
Please look over his email
He wants us to buy him out
Keith and I think this is a joke
We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward
I don t believe the architect work will be of any use to us
I don t think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market
My version of a buyout is attached.I need your expert advise
I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose
Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?
Since their costand fees didn t hold up versus the market and we didn t execute a contract, I wouldn t think they would stand a chance
