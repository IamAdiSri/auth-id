Jim,I read through the data request
We cannot provide several of the items that they requested
We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components
Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers
I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system
Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data
