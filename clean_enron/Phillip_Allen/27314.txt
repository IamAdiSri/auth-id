David,For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3
Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan
The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"
This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution
I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount
I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1
This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares
Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg
8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value
This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns
